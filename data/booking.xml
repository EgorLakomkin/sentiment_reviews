		<Title>Need to gain a healthier vision</Title>
		<Negativereview>I would have appreciated the availability of water from the mini bar, there was only alcoholic drinks in the fridge , no healthy options were available. This resulted in the night being a little uncomfortable</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I liked the variety for breakfast, and the complimentary water in the rooms. I did appreciated being upgraded and found all the staff pleasant, smiling, well presented and friendly They even were helpful concerning getting a taxi at the front.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>This is the first time we have stayed at a hotel that was wonderful from entering the door on our arrival to the time when we left. Every one of the staff was pleasant, helpful and good representatives of The Waldorf hotel. The bedrooms were fantastic, the breakfast and dining room were excellent and the lounge area very comfortable and relaxing. On speaking to other guests at the hotel they all gave similar comments and a number of them had dinner there and said that the meals were very good. Given the fact that the hotel is so central and such an excellent place to stay we would highly recommend this venue to anyone visiting London. EXCELLENT</Positivereview>

		<Title>Great location but not value for money.</Title>
		<Negativereview>We paid for a room for three adults. We got a double room with a single pull out bed. It certainly was not for three adults-two glasses, two tea cups, two dressing gowns. We also paid for executive lounge access and this was a complete waste of money. We asked when it closed and got told 11pm so decided to head up at 8pm. Twenty minutes later a member of staff said to fill our plates as the food was going, nothing was mentioned about the drink going also. However when we went to pour another drink we got a very snappy response that it had finished and that she had told us this. The next morning for breakfast the lady at the desk had said it was busy and to go to the main restaurant. We did to be stood in a queue with about thirty other folk in front of us. We all felt the executive lounge was a complete waste of money. The hotel is in a fantastic location but I believe that you'd get more for your money in other hotels in the area.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>My flight was delayed 24 hours and my room was cancelled despite having already paid the full fee up front. The reception staff were not very pleasant or helpful in helping to resolve the issue. Eventually I was given a room but advised I could not access until after 3pm! I should have been provided access straight away. When I eventually got to my room, it was barely big enough to swing a cat. There was no drawers in the room to be able to unpack properly, only a wardrobe was provided - you cannot hang up socks. Overall not impressed and expected better from the hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Fabulous hotel and room with the best bed. Shame on you for your treatment of guests for breakfast.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Paid for breakfast.£32 when booking. Nothing said about supplement for full English. Could have got better food on any town high street for the supplement cost. Would not have expected this type of very poor food and having to queue for food at this price and at a hotel of this quality. We work very hard for our money and this was a real treat for us completely spoilt for us by having motorway service quality fast food. We treated ourselves in the Savoy 4 yrs ago and for £50 we had the most amazing experience of a breakfast you could ever imagine. That's what I believed the Waldorf would and should have given us.</Negativereview>

		<Title>we enjoyed with all food!</Title>
		<Negativereview>There were few porters in front of the hotel but when we arrived, no one asked us about helping. I'm pregnant and was using a crutch so it could be very nice if one of them ask us to help. because it was very hard to hold my 1 year old daughter with one large suitcase and push chair with a crutch.... When we went to inside the hotel, finally one of porter asked us for bringing our luggage and push chair to our room. So we were not happy with the first service from Claridge's... Also my daughter can walk so she could fall off from the baby cot... and I feel the hotel isn't baby friendly enough.... I shouldn't compare with other hotel but Hotel Bristol (five stared hotel) in Paris had amazing service and was very family friendly so I expected similar service from Claridge's...</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Staffs were friendly and we enjoyed food very much (dinner at Fera and breakfast in our room). Also amanitas were very nice as organic british items. Also there are some organic breakfast as well.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Our superior queen room was nothing more than a basic double. Wasn't impressed with having 5% service added to the bill - surely basic service should be included in the room cost or tips you leave?</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Very disappointed with the overall room. Being older I normally book by phone but in this instance booked onlne. Whenever I stay in london I always get an upgrade. I wasn't offered this facility. Comparing to other hotels I don't think the room was good enough and felt very disappointed as said previously. There was a strange smell of onions which wafted into the room around 7 am which woke us up. Not pleasant. Absolutely no view !</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Due to the flooding of my bathroom from the floor above I felt that a free tray of tea/sandwiches/biscuits and a glass of champagne were not enough recompense for this incident - though they did offer to move me to another room - when I paid the account I noted that they had waived a 5% discretionary service charge which amounted to £30. I have written to them to say that as the staff were all courteous and helpful I felt that the staff discretionary service charge should be reimbursed and that Claridges should have recompensed me in another way.

		<Negativereview>Not much space or surface for guests' toiletries in the bathroom. Bathroom is small. Many things in the room can be refreshed without harming the historic feel. On Saturday morning, at breakfast, guests were a patchy crowd - some wearing sports suits, some dressed up, it's not hotel's fault, just an observation.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Excellent location, attentive friendly staff, breakfast setting and food was nice. Claridge's carries a lot of charm and character. I liked that there is one more door between entrance and bedroom, it makes room very quiet. Comfortable bed.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>I love Claridges, it is a really sincere 5* experience, unlike other hotels who are just ticking the boxes. If you do nothing else treat yourself to their breakfast - amazing. The term "The customer is king" seems second nature in Claridges, they are just short of calling you 'your majesty' and they are only too happy to treat you like a queen! Not an insincere smile in the place - really love it.</Positivereview>

		<Title>great location but really didn't live up to my expection</Title>
		<Negativereview>1.we stayed for five nights, and had to change room twice. At the beginning,we were arranged to a room facing the courtyard with this very noisy ventilation machine. So we didn't sleep well for the first night. After I complained the next day, we were then arrange to a room facing the street and on the top floor, BUT, the cold water system didn't work properly and we couldn't really use the hot water since that would be boiling, the next day (without using any water for one night) they got it fixed, BUT, on that night, there was this weird noise coming from the roof, it was so loud that we could feel the vibration. So we didn't have a good night sleep for the third night. And finally since i complained (at the beginning they didn't take it seriously) they upgraded us to a suite, we finally had two good nights sleep. But the whole experience was so tiring and unsettled.I can understand that such an old and famous hotel is hard to maintain, but thought they had an expensive renovation not long ago? 2.The women in the first floor restroom was so ridiculously rude, i have never experienced anything like that, definitely didn't expect that would happen in Claridge's.</Negativereview>

		<Title>OK, but not exactly a 5-star experience</Title>
		<Negativereview>Hotel undergoing renovation, very little public space - just one quite noisy bar and a library lounge which opens only for 'afternoon tea', shut by 6pm'. Renovations not acknowledged, no apology or info in when these would end/what would be improved. The sauna is separate male/female within the pool changing rooms. Also, a long walk (the length of County Hall) to our room!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Lovely room and bathroom. Excellent location. Nice bar with view to Westminster. There is a 25m swimming pool!!</Positivereview>

		<Title>A magnificent historical building and a respected hotel brand. Ingredients for a great experience.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Room not ready on arrival. No price differential between Children's and adult breakfast. Very expensive! Had to insist to be moved from our breakfast table. Glass on the floor under the table and around us had not been properly cleared from night before? A problem for people with children I would propose.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Unbeatable location for the Southbank area. Great room, better views. Loved the small touch of a toy car in the room as a token apology.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Poor quality hotel (could be magnificent but wasn't). Staff were very mixed. Some were terrific, others (reception person particularly) were poor. Felt no personal attention at all. Very mediocre hotel indeed. Unbelievable noise of drilling in the night as refurbishment still continued at 2am until complained. Only good view of the sights of london if you pay extra. Some rooms directly in front of London Eye with clunking noise whenever it was on.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>You need deep pockets but besides that excellent</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>It was a 5* hotel you get what you pay for, excellent all round. Amazing breakfast with great service. Managed to get a good deal on dinner, for 2 people having 3 courses a glass of wine and a big bottle of water, sat looking at the London eye for £72 including there service charge. I thought that was a great deal considering the location, the quality of the food and our waiter was brilliant. The hotel room was a decent size with a king size bed which was really comfortable. The TV had sky sports and the HD chanels, so I wasn't really bored while I was waiting for the other half to get ready. It was the little things that made the hotel to me, heated mirror so it wouldn't steam up when you were having a shower, a decent iron, complementary coffee and tea, the safe in the room was also free. Every single member of staff we came across all seemed to be happy and greeted us appropriately. I would deffinitly stay here all the time if I could afford it.</Positivereview>

		<Title>River view !</Title>
		<Negativereview>Booked a room with river view and got one at end of building with just one window principally obstructed by view of support structure of London Eye. Complained and was given new room - actually with river view - but told this would be additional £40. Subesquently reversed off bill on checkout. Stayed on 4th floor which was being decorated and had yellow protective tape on floors and painters wandering up and down - removed at 5:30. Also,TV didn't work,but eventually remedied by engineer visit. On checkout,further £50 taken off bill for these inconveniences.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Not worth the money</Title>
		<Negativereview>I requested a double room with 1 bed but got 2 x singles this was only advised to me on arrival. There was no bath in the room just a shower - I like a soak after a days travelling! The TV in the room did not work. The toiletries were meagre to say the least - one tiny bar of soap - no shower gel. The tea and coffee supplies were again very mean - no hot chocolate or biscuits and certainly no complimentary water! The grill bar did not have some advertised items and beware the 'Traditional sherry trifle' it's nothing of the sort - just a clumpy mess of coagulated cream jam and sponge solids - awful. The reception said they would call me back but failed to then do so. I won't be staying here again.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is good - a short walk to the London Eye, the London Aquarium, Waterloo station and the Houses of Parliament.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Great to stay, but be wary of eating there</Title>
		<Negativereview>Standard of the room was very good. However, dinner was a disappointment as the steak was far too rare as it was ordered medium/well. We waited for a member of staff but there was no one around so we left, without finishing the meal. Also, although the selection was good at breakfast, I would expect for the price, to have it cooked to order, and not served buffet style (dried out bacon). To conclude, I would stay at the hotel again as the location and room were exceptional, however, I wouldn't eat there again (including breakfast)</Negativereview>

We loved everything about it; incredible and romantic views across the thames, comfortable luxurious rooms and an elegant cocktail bar. The building is steeped with history and feels warm & friendly despite its huge size. The service was fantastic, Richard (from concierge) kindly organised a romantic thames dinner cruise (Bateaex) which departed from Embankment Pier (just 2 minutes walk), overall a great experience!

		<Negativereview>This is the 3rd time we have visited one of this chains hotels, and the 2nd time in the Royal Horseguards. It's such a beautiful hotel in a central location and the staff are amazing there. It was my girlfriends 30th birthday, and when we arrived at our room they made a lovely slate of a few chocolates with a birthday message written on it for her. Really excellent stay as usual. Oh, by the way anyone who is staying DEFINITELY should opt for the buffet breakfast here. Anything and everything is layed out and everything tastes amazing.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Amazing hotel, room and location, made my special birthday even more special !! :-)</Title>
		<Negativereview><![CDATA[As it was for my 50th birthday, a lovely lady on reception Arg/Ang? very kindly upgraded our room to the 5th floor to a lovely suite with a balcony view of the thames & the London eye, absolutely beautiful views especially at night. She also arranged for bottle of wine in our room after our show. Very clean, comfortable, large room, great facilities, lovely breakfast selection. Amazing location, will definitely go back !]]></Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Having booked the stay to celebrate my mothers 80th Birthday, from the moment we arrived the hotel staff could not have been more attentive or helpful. The hotel is just lovely and a pleasure to stay in, from the comfortable beds to the delicious breakfasts. Location wise excellent, easy to see the historical and notable sights, also the theatre land within walking distance which was important due to my mothers age.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Upsold to a 'Corner Room' described as having great views. Room was in a corner of a corridor, not building, with view of cars parked in street, asked to change and they admitted they had no other rooms, even the one I have previously reserved, they were clearly overbooking to make the most of the season. The Airconditioning/heating in room was not working ( December ) or the phone, my Girlfriend ( Birthday Weekend in London ) did not appreciate the workmen and ladder in room whilst she was getting dressed.... All in all, a huge disappointment for the price, was a regular client, not any more, sadly. Beware, and don't trust the desk staff if they try to sell you a better room, likely it will not be.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Very disappointed with our room, it was very dated and needed a revamp. Messed up my booking and had to be moved, also as I and my elderly grandmother were about to go to sleep, a maid came walking in to our room without knocking or warning for no apparent reason, after calling down to reception to speak to the manger, they told me he would call me back, after waiting 30 minutes I called down and said that I was going to sleep In the morning the manager came up and spoke to us. Absolutely unacceptable for this caliber of hotel, I also left my phone charger behind and didn't realise until i got home, I called up and they told me they would have a look and call me back and that was 12 days ago, and I'm still waiting. I will not be coming back.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>Staff were amazing. Very friendly and always helpful. Especially in Mayfair kitchen restaurant. Check in and check out very smooth. Location of this hotel is perfect. Right in the heart of the action. Nobu restaurant right across the street. Would highly recommend</Positivereview>

		<Title>Wonderful Location, Very Kind, Professional Staff but Cheaply Appointed Guest Rooms</Title>
		<Negativereview>For a supposedly "luxury hotel" the Deluxe Room at the Mayfair was sorely lacking. A very bare minimum in furnishing, no separate sitting room, very small bathroom with only a small shower/tub combination instead of a spacious place to bathe and groom. The bathroom was reminiscent of a cheap Motel 6 in the USA. The closets are a strange lineup of doors that have to be closed in order to open another, etc. The view was the wall of another building. Did we get a Discount room instead of the Deluxe by mistake? Also, the upstairs restaurant was being renovated to what looks like an open, contemporary space...not the rich, warm feel of the former space.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The reservation and housekeeping staff were delightful and very helpful. Stan, the Concierge was very helpful and friendly as were the other Concierge staff. All requests for drivers from and to airport and to Bray were on time, professional, and very personable. The Lobby and Lounge were nice and well appointed.</Positivereview>

Not a huge fan of the "posh" crowd who are sometimes very rude, 'cause they can....and they are legion at the Mayfair.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Unwelcoming reception, room smell disgusting , the layout was horrendous and cheap. Wardrobe inside the toilet area?! Tv on the side wall.? After complains regarding the smell (which they agreed it was very bad) they decided to move us, but to a cheaper room. So we didnt get what we paid for. Toiletries are extremely basic. The spa is so small is suffocating. Overall a horrendous experience all over. Won't be returning , not sure how did they get a 5 star rating. Next time back will stick to the Langham</Negativereview>

		<Title>Surprisingly average</Title>
		<Negativereview>There was a constant noise of air conditioning all night. My wife was unhappy there was no mirror in the bedroom (and the TV was oddly located on a side wall). Running the gauntlet of young men apparently hanging around outside the hotel at 10.30pm was bad enough for us as a couple, it would have been intolerable for a single woman.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location of the hotel is good if you want to spend time in London's West End, close to the shops and theatres. The hotel staff were plentiful and friendly. Our room was adequate if you like drab beige, though we were told we'd been given an upgrade which makes you wonder how small the standard rooms are.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Great location, nice hotel.</Title>
		<Negativereview>I had requested two single beds in advance, when I got there they didn't have any left. They offered us an upgrade and offered to put in an additional bed into this room. They then called the room to say that they didn't actually have any spare beds left. Also got billed for things in the mini fridge that I did not use, this was refunded when I pointed it out.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Breakfast was very good, room was spacious, bed very comfortable. Great location for the tube. Really good restaurant around the corner from the hotel, Novikov</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Being told to return between 1330 and 1400hrs when our room would be ready and was a priority. Returning at 1400hrs to be told that our room wasn't ready but was being cleaned as we spoke. Asking at 1430hrs if rooms were ready to be informed that check in wasn't while 1500hrs. We were aware of the 1500hrs check in time but having been told that they would be ready for 1400hrs it was a little disappointing.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Expected more from a 5* hotel in Mayfair</Title>
		<Negativereview>1) Towels were faded from washing, bathroom floor towel had coffee stains on it 2) I was served a flat white coffee in the most basic cafeteria cup, made by machine with the most basic roast. I was charged 4.75 GBP which is outrageous for the quality. If you decide to price it 4.75 GBP you shall provide value for it especially if you are a 5* Mayfair Hotel</Negativereview>

		<Title>Maybe the glory is fading just a little..</Title>
		<Negativereview>The location - it used to be a quite quiet area, very upmarket and exclusive but things have changed in central London and what really frustrated us about this visit was the level of very late night street noise - I was woken in the early hours by music from a nearby bar / club and then the roar of supercars going up and down the street. This hasn't happened before - maybe we should be more specific with our room location ( 752 - by the way). The bar - We got back to the hotel late afternoon and headed to the bar for cocktails, £64 for four drinks - they were good ( for that money you would expect it) but the experience was slightly tainted by the fact that there were a group of male overseas guests who thought it was the done thing to scream at the top of their voices like they owned the place. Maybe they did, I don't know! There were 3 huge doorman in the bar and on the doors at 4pm in the afternoon - this is a five star hotel In Mayfair!! They were unobtrusive, we never felt uncomfortable in any way but It sort of says something about the place that they have to do this. That said, It didn't ruin the experience in anyway - maybe its just how it is in central London hotels these days Maybe our tastes are changing but for the cost of the room, it wasn't outstanding - its good but not exceptional on this visit. There's a lot of choice in London these days and The Mayfair does a lot of things well but for our wedding anniversary trip, I just had that feeling it could've been so much better for the money we spent if we had tried somewhere else.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We've stayed at the Mayfair a few times - pre renovation and post so over a fair number of years - and the best thing about the hotel is the location still. On the plus side, the public areas still look great, nothing to fault.</Positivereview>

Carpets are will worn. Cooked breakfast very poor, served on cold plates, and by the time you have sat down to eat it, it is cold. Poor range of breakfast and poor lighting again. I had to ask twice for mine to be cooked properly and warmed! and by that time, I had lost interest. I wouldn't stay here again.

		<Negativereview>The reception staff were lovely, I turned up straight from work and probably didn't look as polished as most guests but my welcome was just the same which was refreshing. My husband and I like to treat ourselves and make an effort to have a night together and find that some establishments judge you on appearance but very happy to report this was not the case at the May Fair. Thank you we had a lovely stay</Negativereview>

When I first checked in to the hotel my debit card was getting declined and it did a few times, I opted to pay a certain amount with cash and a certain amount with the card, the manager sincerely apologised and was very polite.

		<Negativereview>It was quite late when someone came to clean our room, by which point we were trying to get ready to go for a pre-theatre dinner so our room was not fully cleaned. The fact that a member of staff stayed on after her finishing time to do a turndown when we got back from the theatre made up for this however.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is in a great location, close to Green Park tube station but it is also easy to walk to lots of the main tourist attractions from the hotel. The staff are also willing to go above and beyond to help you.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>Fantastic hotel, honestly couldn't fault it. Location, staff and hotel all five * We stayed for one evening, was meant to check in at 3pm but arrived early about 1ish and it was no problem the room was ready. We had to check out at 12pm the next day but was going to see a show in the evening so asked if we could store our bags (shopping and travel bags) and they did so we could collect them later that evening after the show. Will be staying again.</Positivereview>

When i tried to enter the place at New Year's eve using the entrance from within the hotel, i had my hand stamped. I have never been treated in such a disrespectful manner at any hotel and I am shocked that the management of the hotel tolerates such actions from the staff of their bar. Absolutely unacceptable and i consider it as a good reason to avoid this establishment in the future.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Lovely stay at the Nadler Victoria.</Title>
		<Negativereview>All the staff were friendly and efficient, without exception. The room (small double) was small, but well equipped, comfortable and stylish. I loved the fur throw and the slightly surreal illuminated book spines... the recharging points and extra cables were a nice touch. The bathroom was pristine, and the shower was enormous. The teeny kitchenette was just what we needed, and I wish my sink at home looked as shiny (though a dishcloth might have helped me leave it tidier). We asked for a quiet room, and it really was quiet- no disturbances at all, honestly the most peaceful night's sleep I have ever had at a hotel. This was an exploratory visit- we were sizing the place up for a possible return to a Nadler with our child and dog, and it certainly convinced us to do this.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Clean, welcoming place but very cramped room</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was exceedingly small - difficult for two people to walk around it. It was also dark being on the ground floor with one small window that looked on to other buildings. Phone signal was weak.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is excellent - very close to Victoria train station, Buckingham Palace and St James' Park and within easy walking distance of Westminster. Staff were really friendly and helpful - they could not have been more welcoming. Room was clean with all basic facilities including kettle, fridge and microwave. There were plenty of coffee houses and restaurants nearby.</Positivereview>

The modern conveniences did not always work (coffee maker, automatic lights--if someone leaves the room, they must take the key card to access the elevator and the person left in the room has no electricity as it is only on with the key card). The view out our windows? Two buildings under construction. There is no breakfast included.</Negativereview>

Small breakfast menu available, collected from neighboring shops and delivered to you without extra margins charged. Service was very friendly and attentive.

		<Title>My new favorite hotel, anywhere</Title>
		<Negativereview>The Nadler Victoria just became our favorite hotel anywhere in the world. What an amazing experience! The staff was beyond professional and so helpful. They exhibited the kind of customer service in the hospitality business a frequent traveler only dreams of. In fact, we didn't know it still existed. So good on them. Shout out to Sophie who was amazing and really helped make our short stay in London memorable. The location couldn't be better -- close to Buckingham Palace, walking distance to so many things and the tube is right there. It's also super easy access to the train station at Victoria Station to get to the airport, Gatwick direct, Heathrow a couple stop overs but easy. The room was huge and so comfortable. They had a little kitchenette that was extremely helpful. The beds are more comfortable then my own bed at home. Big bathroom with lovely amenities. The hotel does not have a restaurant which some folks list as a negative but I gotta say, it really didn't matter. It's very boutique style. There are so many places close by to eat and also little bodega type mini marts so not having a bar or restaurant or that kind of full service hotel really didn't matter. The location, the rooms themselves and the staff won us over. I'll never stay anywhere else in London again. Fantastic value for the money.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview><![CDATA[A lot construction in progress in nearby area which starts working at 8am. The hotel wall isolation is good but still a little bit noise you could hear. They don't have canteen but offer discounts for guest dine in nearby restaurants though. We enjoy buying different breakfast options in M&S with the little kitchen it's not a problem for us at all!]]></Negativereview>
		<Positivereview><![CDATA[Very close to the Buckingham palace mew gift shop. 5 mins walk to Victoria station and there is a Marks & Spencer there, walkable distance to most of zone 1 attractions! It's a brand new hotel start operation from Jan 2016, room is spacious with a little kitchen and even a nespresso machine! The shower and hair dryer all work well! And staff all very friendly :)]]></Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Very nice well equipped, but on the small side - still had a lovely cosy filling to it. Espresso machine, microwave in the room. So many cafe's, pubs and nice restaurants in under 5 min. walk. The whole area has changed a lot over the last 2-3 years. Only 6 min. walk from Victoria.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>The hotel is new and really great value for money, while I was on business and alone I would also recommend the hotel for couples and leisure trip. While rooms are quite small they are fine and in London most of the day is spent out touring. The facilities are good with basic kitchen in each room. and staff were helpful and friendly. while the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar this is not an issue as there are plenty within 150 meters, and cafes within 50 meters for breakfast, also the hotel will order in for you or you can do yourself. All in all a great choice and value.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Photos are misleading. We had booked a Large Double room which I refused to accept when I saw it! It was barely big enough for a kid. We were moved to a "larger" room, where if you put two suitcases on the floor, you can't walk pass through to the bathroom anymore. You cannot open the windows in this hotel(!!!), due to safety reasons (we were told so at the reception). So you've got two options: either suffocate or put on the a/c. I would consider the second one if the a/c wasn't blowing directly at my head while sleeping! The kitchenette and Nespresso coffee machine is a good touch if we had more space to actually enjoy it!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is brand new, very clean and located less then 5 min walk from Victoria tube station which is one of the most central hubs in London. The staff is friendly and ready to help with anything.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Perfect stay in London!</Title>
		<Negativereview>The location near Victoria Underground was perfect for us. Staff is very helpful. Bathroom is nice with a big shower. I didn't like my pillow that much, was way to hard for a good sleep. I told the staff and they immediately provided me a softer pillow. Perfect!</Negativereview>

		<Title>Modern, stylish accommodation with great staff in convenient location - great!</Title>
		<Negativereview>There is no outlook from the rooms as the hotel is on an alley with some construction work in the vicinity which might be important to some people - it was not overly noisy though and the convenience of location make up for this.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is brand new, very modern and stylish and decorated to a high standard. I was very comfortable in my American style room which had a small fridge, microwave, kettle and coffee machine as well as functioning wifi and new tech lighting system and security. However the most important thing was the staff who are very welcoming, friendly and helpful, but also they are excited and happy to be working here which makes a huge difference! Not only that but I left my nightdress behind and emailed the following day asking them to keep it until I was back in London 3 weeks later which they did, so I am very impressed.</Positivereview>

Second time was missing items that were given first time round (OJ, Croissants), and milk was off and thick like cottage cheese. Worse still, when trying to call room service to get them to resolve the issue there was no answer! The decor is getting a bit worn and tired.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview><![CDATA[We were impressed with the Rembrandt Hotel in every way. Efficient friendly check-in, spotlessly clean rooms, friendly helpful staff and great location. We also had breakfast & lunch, which was very good. There is a huge pool with poolside bar, which is great for lounging around. The views are great from the rooms, entrance foyer an extravaganza and nothing is a problem at this Hotel. I will always stay here on my return trips to Bangkok.]]></Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>We have stayed here a number of times and love the location. It's not far from the train, just down the road from terminal 21 shopping centre, there's some handy little restaurants near by and two parks for exercise. The hotel is very comfortable and we have always well looked after. We will stay again!!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The beds were a little firm and there was an overpowering smell of air freshener in the hotel lobby -a bit too much! Door staff were not very helpful when trying to get a metered taxi to the airport as they wanted us to use the hotel mini bus (which was much more expensive)</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Staff were efficient ,friendly and organised.The breakfast was very good -Thai, Indian and western food and plenty of good coffee. The location was also good.The pool was great for relaxing at after a morning sight seeing.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>The room got a sea view which is wonderful and also if you walk here to the town centre it only takes you 3mins which is quite convenient and after you check out you can still use ur room to storgeyour luggage and they won't ask you to check out in the early morning like before 10 or11 am which is really convenient also cool!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Went the during winter, so it was really cold at night. The room has air-conditioner but I can't find heater. Plus, lack the toiletries provided. They only gave 2 soaps and no shampoo.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Near to the main square and the bus terminal so it's easy to get around santorini. The hottle provides shuttle service to the airport. Staffs were great and friendly. After the airport pick up, she showed me the things nearby how to get to bus terminat and what' interesting in Fira. After reaching hotel, she gave map and explained all the attractions around santorini. Finally, she assisted me to go to the room personally and explained things inside the room.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Don't use if in a wheelchair</Title>
		<Negativereview>The rooms are very small. Too warm, we needed the disabled room, room 104, the room was not accessible for a wheelchair user, there is only 18" at either size of the bed to get in or out, the mattress was smaller than the bed base which bruised the backs of my legs , there was no window in the room and the air in the room was stuffy. In the bathroom, it was a full fitted wet room for my needs, but the sink was very small, it didn't empty very well,it took ages to get a wash. Back to the bedroom, there was no mirror at the dressing table, bearing in mind disabled people need to sit to do their hair and make up, the mirror was in front of the bed. No where near the dressing table. We did complain about the room and all of above, they promised a free cooked breakfast the next morning , which we didn't expect,. We ordered it and waited over 45 mins for it. The breakfast room wasn't busy. When we questioned where it was, it hadn't even been started, so we left and went into town as our day was being wasted. I won't be booking it again.</Negativereview>

Worst of all though, the plug socket was broken and I got electrocuted while I was trying to plug in phone charger. When I complained to reception they said absolutely nothing and the manager wasn't around to speak to. I have been waiting almost a week now for them to call me as every time I call them the manager is not available.

		<Title>Small and comfy, very clean - handy for central London without the price tag!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Asked for ID - passport / driving licence etc. Has never happened to me before in a UK hotel. Britain abandoned the national identity card scheme many years ago and there is no obligation for a British citizen to carry ID, and I don't usually carry my passport with me! If it is hotel policy that you have to provide ID then this should be stated on your booking pages. Incidentally, the Best Western in Bournemouth never asked so I am somewhat dubious this is the case.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Highest concentration of plug sockets and light switches I have ever encountered in a hotel room - 3 double sockets in the desk area alone! Inadvertently, switched the heated towel rail on but never managed to find the switch that did it to turn it off. Despite the baffling array of switches very comfy and good value for central London. Staff friendly.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Good value hotel - ok for an overnight!</Title>
		<Negativereview>My room (113) was exceptionally small. So small my shins hit the end of the wooden bed frame when I walked in the room. I would go so far as to say they have squished a double bed into a box room! No space at all to manoeuvre around the room and that was with one side of the bed shoved up against the wall! Also no mirror in the bedroom - there was a huge mirror in the bathroom but not much use when wanting to dry my hair of check I was presentable! There was a small window (that doesn't open!) outside of which was clearly home to the pigeons! Rudely awoken by the cooing at 5am wasn't great</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The reception staff were helpful and friendly. Check in was smooth. Service with a smile! Bar/dining area was pleasant with a small but varied menu the food was very good Breakfast - complimentary continental - there was enough choice to start the day and for those with a bigger appetite you can order a cooked breakfast, from the menu, at a reasonable price. 3 minute walk from Kilburn station</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The staff were extremely poor. Firstly the gentlemen behind the desk said we can pay on checkout as we bothwere paying cash,next minute he had taken out of my card i booked with which left me overdrawn and charged. Awful. Secondly for breakfast the lady serving us got our breakfast wrong THREE times. I am still shocked we paid for it.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Despite the bed being a very comfortable king size, the room was too small for such a large bed. There was barely enough room to squeeze around the bed to the other side. There was so little space left, that there was really nowhere to put luggage.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Staff were extremely friendly. The bed was comfortable, but there was a down side to this - see what I didn't like. A good size bathroom with a large shower. Very handy to Kilburn tube station on the Bakerloo line.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The rooms were wayyyy too small! There was no porter to help us with our 6 suitcases. The restaurant was refurbishing when we arrived so only breakfast was available. Our initial room was down in a cold basement and virtually impossible to locate. Thanks to Martina, she was able to change our rooms.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>First of all I was given a small room with no air conditioning remote control, a tv remote control or a telephone. I used my mobile phone to call down and ask for these things plus an iron and after 40 minutes I decided to get dressed and head to reception were I was told the guy I spoke to had forgot about my call. I eventually got the above items, ironed my shirt and was heading out when I switched off the iron which caused the socket to blow sparks and the room electrics to trip out. Another call to reception and they decided to move me into another room. The next night, whilst sat on my bed doing some work on my laptop one of the reception staff decided to open my door and show in an old couple who appeared to be shocked by the sight of me in my underpants. No apology, just everyone turning around and walking out again. Not a good experience and not one word of apology for any of it suggests the staff are used to this kind of stuff.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The room carpet was torn up and a few floorboards were broken in room 208. the mattress on the bed was rock hard and needs replacing. Air conditioning in room was non existent and the heat from bathroom added to this problem. TV Remote was broken in my room Hotel restaurant / breakfast - kitchen fryer or grill was broken so only 10% of restaurant menu on offer. No cooked breakfast in the morning available either and staff didn't even explain this, very poor communication with guests. Also card payments were not working at the restaurant so I had to go to the nearest Street atm and return to restaurant.</Negativereview>

The interior of the room was obviously not very new, you could not open the window and the amount of sockets was very little. The safe in the closet was broken, lights in the closet hung out and there were very limited possibilities to place your belonings on shelves etc. After getting the room cleaned by room service there was still hair on the bathroom floor.

		<Negativereview>Despite all the positive reviews, we had problem with cleanness of our rooms. Our first room wasn't cleaned up after the previous guests and we found items like bottles, food wraps/food, socks etc. all around the room with enough hair in the bed to make a wig. After complaining at the reception, we were given different room. However, the second room didn't have windows and was adjusted for disabled persons, which was a little uncomfortable. Moreover, cleanness was an isue here as well, dirty floors, dust everywhere (my girlfriend is allergic to dust), and the wash basin was cloged. We reported this the very next morning, and the receptionist assured us it would be taken care of, except it wasn't. I felt very uncomfortable in this hotel and cannot recomend it to anybody.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>The hotel is in a great location with easy access to buses and tubes. The rooms were of good size if a little dark (the back of the hotel), bed comfortable and the bathroom was very nice with a lovely size bath. Sadly we had a problem with lights and air conditioning. The main lights above the TV were not working, we logged a call, a maintenance man came within minutes and they were fixed!! but he legged it without fixing the air conditioning! Later the lights wouldn't go off something we didn't notice until we came back late. We had to sleep with these lights on :-( however this was addressed in the final bill. Breakfast was continental style, good and adequate. Staff friendly, helpful and smiley. I would use this hotel again.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Never again</Title>
		<Negativereview>The bed made a crinkley noise everytime we moved. The fire alarm was malfunctioning 3/4 nights we stayed and went off at ungodly hours of the early morning. The lady at the desk asked if we wanted a twin room even though we fooled a double. Our free breakfast on out last day (we only received because we complained about the fire alarm) was cold. On our first night there were noises all night from out upstairs neighbor. The "free wifi" was crap, we were only given 3 passwords for 4 days that only allowed 1 device. Turndown service never made the bed, I found garbage in the room that was not from us including a condom wrapper. We will definitely come back to London but we will meet again stay at the Beat Western Maitrise Hotel.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Not much, the only semi redeeming thing was free breakfast on our checkout day as the fire alarm sounded at 6:30 and 7, 3 of the 4 nights we stayed.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Aftet my evening meal, I went to my room and was quite sick, there was a loud noise which went on quite a while which sounded like a car horn, apparently there was a problem with the water pressure. This kept me awake until about 3am. Then to top it all off the fire alarm went off at 7am. What an absolutely horrendous stay. I was not given a receipt for my stay. Never agsin</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I thought the restaurant could have been better there wasn't much choice but I thought it would be like that as it was very early in the season if not out of season, a bit of a trek to the town, harbour and beach but with the driver Vladimir only charging €2 per journey in or out it really didn't bother me he was excellent always on time when he tells you he'd be there !</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The small apartment I had was well fitted out with flat screen TV DVD player beds were comfortable and the kitchen was excellent with a washing machine and the cleaners came in regularly as well overall very very happy with the apartment,</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Staff welcome left a bit to be desired. Lack of English (this isn't so much a negative, just made it a bit difficult to communicate and led to a large amount of time completing fairly mundane tasks). Very out of the way from the city and nightlife.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Slightly disappointing</Title>
		<Negativereview>Staff could hardly speak English. We booked the shuttle to paphos harbour but it took an hour to turn up and when it did they refused to take us. The staff suggested a taxi but by this point we had sat at reception for 1hour 15 minutes. Towels in the villa were insuffient-only one bath towel for 2 people was provided. Don't bother with a glass of wine, both red and white are served from the box out of the fridge.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The villa we rented was lovely, 2 double bedrooms both with an ensuite. Very clean and well presented with wifi and a good range of kitchen amenities.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The receptionist- he looked upset and grumpy :(</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is not a hotel or a resort in the way we, or, at least, I imagine. There are small villas and blocks of flats, probably built for a residential purpose, but then turned into a resort. Therefore, when we booked an apartment with 2 rooms, we got a small villa with 2 en-suite bedrooms, living room with extensible couch, beautiful view, nice veranda. The blocks have communal pools (unable to use winter time) as we could see from the balcony. In the reception area, there is a bar, a mini-market (closed for now), the restaurant (I don't know if they serve food or snacks during the day time, but they do nice cocktails) and a big outdoor pool, playground for kids (indoor and outdoor). At the basement there is a massage saloon, 2 changing rooms with saunas and a heated indoor pool. Breakfast: options for English and continental breakfast. The orange juice is diluted, so it doesn't really have a nice flavour. Dinner: buffet with meat and fish options, pasta and other sides.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Service was very poor. The rooms were dirty, there were rat traps in the kitchen cabinets were the food was supposed to be stored, the dinner was awful, and we end up ordering Macdonalds. The cutlery were so dirty and I have photos to prove it.They run out of Nescafe during the breakfast, they had no snacks whatsoever for the kids. In general, in my opinion the hotel shouldn't be running.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Not what we was expecting from the description</Title>
		<Negativereview>The menu was a fixed menu so didn't like that we went half board but had a limited choice available. Although I can understand it is out of season and therefore there aren't as many guests. But we would have preferred a buffet service. The hot tub wasn't working and the saunas are one in the male and female changing rooms. As a couple we wanted to enjoy this together. The female one was out of order so I had to go in the male. The shower in the female changing room was also broken. You have to buy towels from reception to use in the indoor pool as room towels are not allowed to be used. Also it is literally in the middle of nowhere so if you want to have a few drinks or go out for a meal you have to have a taxi or drive into paphos. Personally I wouldn't go again out of season and we had originally booked for June too but have cancelled. Maybe it would be better in season when hopefully the pool bar and buffet menu would be available but will await some positive reviews first.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The room was lovely although we paid for an upgrade to a one bedroom apartment with separate bedroom and never received it. It was lovely and clean and the kitchen area was well stocked with ample utensils to cook a nice meal.</Positivereview>

		<Title>The room was very spacious.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The apartment is very bare, and there are no supplies, except for dishwashing liquid and a bar of soap. The establishment seems to be a bit stingy with supplies and housekeeping, example, towels only changed every 4 days, housekeeping every 2 days, no supplies in the apartment. Although for the price of the apartments, I guess we can't complain too much, since we got a clean and spacious room. The reception desk is mostly unmanned. Also, there is supposed to be a mini market on site, and it was also empty mostly, we couldn't even get water from there. The breakfast isn't that great, so I would recommend eating out. Wifi connection is also very weak,. Location is OK, but you will need a car to get around since it is not walking distance to anywhere!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The room was very spacious. There was a nice swimming pool although it was too cold at the time so we could not use it. The indoor and outdoor play areas were fun for our children.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Though website states parking. There is none. 40 pounds a day for a van if you can find room during events. WiFi charge excessive though they did waver it after complaint. Single room was tiny only 2.2 x 1.8 mtrs including bathroom but excellent shower. For sleep only it's fine but no wardrobe, coat hangers etc. Overall a great price for London and typical converted old building.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Location to olympia very good. Ideal for central and West London. Road not too busy though room at rear of property would be quieter.</Positivereview>

And he had no idea where that parking was. I ended up paying 35£. After all this he was rude as well.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Very noisy wouldn't recommend...</Title>
		<Negativereview>Really don't recommend! My room was right next to the breakfast room and because there was a big gap between the floor and my door, it was impossible to sleep from after 7 am! Even when breakfast finished at 930am the staff would literally shout to each other, clearly not respecting any of the guests. I stayed here because it was fairly close to the hospital I was working at over the weekend, I work late shifts so it was important to get proper sleep - which I was unable to get any of here! Furthermore, because of the gap between the door and floor I could smell the smoke from the staffs cigarette in my room (not sure why they would smoke inside the facility anyway)... Very bad experience. Cleanliness wasn't so great either, there were a lot of black hairs on my bed when I arrived and the walls were extremely dirty.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>Location to tubes and buses. In a good and nice area. Bed really comfy but single room was very small!! It was at the front of the hotel which wasn't a problem, but the room was so hot even with the window open. Plenty of tea and coffee, and the fridge in the rooms are a great addition. Hey it's not the Ritz but for its location the price is good for where the hotel is. This is my second time here and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The walls in the room needed a good coat of paint, they were marked, paint flaking and some damp. The floor was some type of Formica floor boards which were badly chipped. The floor also needed cleaning, lots of hairs on it. I was a single woman and was put in a single room with patio doors opening on to the gardens off Holland Road. I wouldn't have been very happy if it had been the summer and not been able to open the doors (window) as I suspect the room will be very hot.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Aweful. Don't stay here.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The photos of this place are deceiving. I had a single room in the basement, and it was full of mold. It smelled so musty. And even though it was "non smoking" the entire place reeks of smoke. Plus the staff smokes right outside the windows and the fans pull it in. The bed was so lumpy. I had two nights booked and it was so bad that I ended up taking a loss and finding another place for the second night. Don't waste your money here.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Misleading Car Park information!!!</Title>
		<Negativereview>The low standard state of cleanliness and the fact that the website in booking.com mentioned that the parking is GBP6 when it is actually GBP9.50 (for 24hours) and it is located within Westfield. If I know that this is the case, I wouldn't have book it as I am travelling with a toddler and no parking space within 5minutes from the hotel is not acceptable for me. I am carrying quite a bit of luggages and walking all the way to Westfield is not a good experience. The information for the parking can be more explicit. If it is at Westfield, say so and also update the price for the parking. This is not the right way to operate a biz. Really sore about the parking arrangement.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The breakfast is what really let this down for us. Cornflakes, toast, cheese and hot drinks. For a continental breakfast I would have thought that croissants would also be included with jams. Also the lady on duty in the breakfast room really does need to smile as she looks so miserable in her job!!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>In the main staff were very friendly, polite and knowledgable. The rooms were okay, lovely and warm and we had a good nights sleep for the four nights we were here. Yes the odd lick of paint is needed, but I really cannot see why some people are giving this place such bad reviews. For the money we paid it is exceptional value and for London its a great price to be paying!! Plus it was also quiet and no banging of doors in the middle of the night, or noisy drunken people coming in at all hours.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The lack of fresh air/ heating control as above - but we have cleaner skin I'm sure!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I was sharing with a friend, so we had 2 singles on the top floor, the room was clean and had everything you need, no window and it was HOT, up 3 flights of steep stairs, so if you are not very fit you may want to enquire the location of the room before hand as there is no lift - a struggle after having sat driving for 2 hours. There is a thermostat in the room but it's lowest setting is 18 degrees, and couldn't be altered, but that would be the only criticism. The parking is only overnight and you do need to leave before 8am to avoid a ticket, so something to be aware of. The staff were friendly, breakfast was cereal, toast, boiled eggs and cheese available all self service. Perfectly adequate for a quick break away.</Positivereview>

		<Title>As ever with hostels, you get what you pay for.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Unfortunately, the quiet is not constant by any means. Firstly, the doors are very, very poor at filtering noise, so you can very frequently hear what's going on in the hallway, and it goes so to the point that you can't tell the difference between knocking on your door and someone else's. Secondly, one is well advised not to forget what the Y in YHA stands for - the hostel is frequented by youth groups of various sorts, and when one of them is having breakfast, filtering through the lobby or going to their rooms, it's complete pandemonium. The rooms are also not kept to quite hotel standards - the only thing they do in the daytime is replenish the complimentary teabags, and the walls and floor of the rooms look slightly rough. Honestly though, you get what you pay for, and if you're not a complete clean freak there shouldn't be any problem with this. Lastly, a word of warning to anyone above 6ft - the beds are quite short.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>As ever with hostels, you get what you pay for. YHA Thameside features small but reasonably well-appointed rooms at a relatively good location in Rotherhithe, a very quiet neighbourhood with bus/Tube links that take you to central London in around 20 minutes (take the Jubilee line to either Bermondsey or Canada Water, then bus 381 which stops right outside the door). A full English breakfast is available for a reasonable price, as is a simple dinner (which I never tried so can't really speak for). Staff are friendly and the place is usually very quiet at night for a hostel.</Positivereview>

		<Title>All in all I was pleasantly surprised by the hostel and would recommend it to others.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The bathroom could have been cleaner and a plug in the sink might have been useful too. There was mould on the ceiling (probably as there was no window to ventilate properly) although all areas appeared to be clean. A little more shelf space would have been good too. The shower head was not removable for washing your hair so water went everywhere.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The Youth Hostel is situated in a residential area which was quiet and seemed safe.</Positivereview>

Great position, green and calm area, great view to the City and Metropolitan Wharf from the small private rooms (on Thames side), 20 minutes by walk to Tower Bridge, in front of a bus stop and very close to the metro stop Rotherhithe (5min) and Canada Water (10 min walk). Availability of a common cooking area (incl. microwave owen) very useful in the expensive London. Pleasant common area with free access wi fi</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>I went back to my room on the second day of my stay and there was someone sleeping in my bed. All other beds were occupied too. They simply put somebody else in the room and did not put me anywhere. Fortunately they still had one bed in another room. I had to pick up all my stuff and move them, that was really annoying. And the shower was weird and sometimes cold.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Budget efficiency but dirty and crappy</Title>
		<Negativereview>Overall the facilities are old, especially those in the room. The blanket in the room is extremely dirty. Faucets were not working well. The room and corridors stink terribly. And I also wonder why this youth hostel can accept an old man to stay. Also, during my stay I saw more than one family each with several kids. And those kids just keep running and playing around in the self-catered kitchen.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>This is a very budget efficient choice in costly London. It looks a bit far away from the city centre but in fact it's okay if you don't mind walking 5 mins from tube station.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Wonderful stay, grande indeed and talented chef</Title>
		<Negativereview>Honestly nothing best hotel I've stayed in</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>From beginning to end a wonderful hotel. Prime example of you get what you pay for. This hotel is in a beautiful old building that certainly gives it the grand feeling. When we arrived our bags were taken for us and the door held open by the doorman we were greeted by a lovely lady on reception. We started our honeymoon here before flying out of Gatwick. The hotel had a bottle of very nice prosecco waiting for us in the room on ice. This was a very nice touch and added to our stay. The rooms were a good size and had everything you needed Twinings tea, coffee, Galaxy coco, shortbread biscuits, slippers, robes, iron, tv. All very clean and felt like home. The breakfast is fantastic, served as a buffet. I always think you can tell a good restaurant by the sausages they serve and these were amazing! They had big tables which they layed different options and there was a lot to choose from; English cooked breakfast, fruits, yogurts, cereals, cakes, pastrys. We booked for afternoon tea which was wonderful, I rate it higher than the harrods afternoon tea. They clearly have a talented chef here, we got a generous amount of sandwiches, because I'm a picky eater they brought me my own plate of chicken sandwiches. Next the scones, fresh and good eating. And finally the cakes indulgent rich chocolate things and very tarte fruity things. Wonderful experience and will recommend to all.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Lovely, friendly hotel - despite lack of sleep...</Title>
		<Negativereview>We booked a premium sea facing room and were looking forward to a relaxing stay. When we arrived the receptionist mentioned that there was a wedding and that there may be a 'little noise'. However when we arrived home after a lovely dinner in Brighton, the room was filled with bass and noise from the wedding reception below (we were located on the first floor). As a result, we found it difficult to relax and sleep, which was the sole reason for our visit to The Grand. If we had known, we would have booked a cheaper room to the rear of the hotel. In fairness to the hotel, when I did express my disappointment upon checking out, they gave us £100 off the room rate (i.e price of a rear facing room) and have promised us an upgrade upon our next visit, which was appreciated. We are interested to see if this materializes, but no reason to suggest it will not. Scrambled eggs are not the best... but the rest of breakfast was of a good standard. Other than this, we did enjoy our stay, and do look forward to returning, but will be hoping for a more restful stay! Staff were all very pleasant. PS - A touch of paint to the front steel columns as you enter would be a good idea, as looking a little shabby.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Great location and friendly staff. Love the old worldly feel to the place. Piano playing on the edge of the foyer was a lovely touch.</Positivereview>

		<Title>The staff were generally friendly, polite and helpful.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was very large but rather austere. The bathroom in contrast was too small (long and narrow with badly positioned shower cubicle) and very much in need of refurbishment. Noise from an event downstairs on the night of our stay unfortunately kept us awake until 3 am. I would say the room was adequate but we expected more for the price we paid.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were generally friendly, polite and helpful. The location is central and convenient with parking (multi storey at an extra cost) just around the corner. Sea view. Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The splendid bar on the ground floor is undergoing refurbishment, section by section. The work needs doing but inevitably it reduces the appeal of this area. We are regular visitors but the receptionist hadn't picked this up so told us a whole lot of stuff we already knew. At this level of hotel, that shouldn't happen.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Mediocre</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was shabby and tired and for £500 for two nights is plainly over priced. It had no air conditioning but I had to listen ironically to the fans of the air con units located outside. The room was too hot so a fan is provided but is so noisy it destroys any tranquillity. No extractor fan in the bathroom so odours and steam do not dissipate contributing to a below par experience.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Bed was comfy. Location excellent. Staff could not do enough and were the saving grace of a hotel that tries to punch above its weight. Shower in the room was also good.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>I loved the height of the ceilings and the beautifully maintained historical artefacts - pillars, etc. I thought the staff were superb - they couldn't have been better. They made me feel very welcome and were most attentive at all times. They were considerate and listened sympathetically when I complained about the awful room I was put in on the first floor. I thought this room was APPALLING value for. . money. However, I was upgraded to a room on the 6th floor which was super, with a wonderful view. I thought the room on the 1st floor was HUGELY overpriced.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>A second arm chair by the table would have been nice, so we could have sat and had a cup of tea together, there is plenty of space! The bathroom looks tired, the taps were old and missing the hot/cold plaques. The overhead shower just dribbled tepid water; very disappointing. The windows looked straight into the next door hotel windows across a very narrow space, so we felt that we needed to keep the curtains closed to get any privacy.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The shower in our room was rubbish - the pressure and temperature controls were both useless. The gym is disappointing and the breakfast wasn't as nice as we'd hoped, especially when it came to fruit. On the whole, we didn't feel it was great value for money. We've stayed in 5 star hotels that cost less so we don't think there is justification for the current room rate.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Shabby hotel not grand at all!</Title>
		<Negativereview>The public interior areas are awful. Lacked cleanliness! Furniture looks out of place. You know when you see an old sofa dumped on the side of the road.... They have these dumped on every floor by the stairs! Very out of place. No continuity to the furniture and no style. The crappy miniature vases with a wilted geranium on the window sills on the grand stair case had me asking 'why bother'! The hotel needs to invest in some decent decor and artwork/flowers/sculptures to compliment it... Not to stand out like a sore thumb!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Our room was a pleasant surprise compared to the rest of the hotel. Pay extra for deluxe sea view! Large and modern. Shame about the rest of the hotel!</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>A beautiful and luxurious hotel, reminiscent of a bygone age. That doesn't mean The Grand is tired or stuffy; quite the contrary. The service was second-to-none: attentive, respectful and kind. Our room was reasonably spacious and very comfortable. We also appreciated the fact that they allow dogs, and they offer private on-site parking with valet service.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Waited 1 and a half hours to book in. Rooms were tatty looking with chipped paintwork. Furniture scratched. . When we wanted to sit in the bar area there was nowhere for guests only so had to wait for outsiders to leave before getting a seat. Breakfast, 1st day was fine, food all labelled, 2nd day no labelling and food cold. Last day at breakfast 1 waiter was so scruffy looking and unshaven. Windows were filthy, carpets fraying. Grand it certainly isn't.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Amazing hotel with amazing staff</Title>
		<Negativereview>First room dated, but we were upgraded for free as soon as I asked the price of an upgrade</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were amazing, couldn't do anymore to help us, we booked an inland classic double, which was dated, so I enquired about the cost of an upgrade, the member of staff on the reception did this for us free of charge, which was amazing. While waiting for our room to be ready we sat in the lounge area, which we were greeted by a waiter who took our drinks order, a beer and a cocktail, my girlfriend ordering the cocktail found it too strong (not a fan of alcohol) to which the waiter noticed she hadn't drunk much and asked if everything was okay, we explained and he then took the drink adding lemonade and sugar syrup to which helped a lot. The room was great, we had a view overlooking the sea, and could even see Brighton Pier from our window. The concierge took our bags, and my car keys and parked (parking was advertised for 24hr, 3pm-3pm but we arrived at midday on arrival and didn't leave until half five, and the staff were more than happy for us to keep the car there for the whole time at no extra charge) Every member of staff no matter what time of day greeted us, which you don't get a lot. Our stay included breakfast, which we overslept and got down around half nine (I was expecting very little left). We got to the podium waiting to be seated (hardly waited the matter of seconds) when a manger came running over to us apologising for the wait and took us to a table. The buffet was still full of food, despite the time and how busy it was, almost every table was full. We ordered coffee (one latte and a cafetiere) I was surprised that the latte was included as most places it's either filter coffee or tea. Overall we really enjoyed the hotel and will definitely be back, my advise would be to spend the little more on a deluxe room as there is a huge difference in quality of room, almost like being in a different hotel.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Brighton was great but the Grand Brighton not so good.....</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room only had a window that was obscured so you couldn't look out of the window at all. We experience numerous power outages and were woken up at 2am on the last night by a 75dB noise (measured on an ios app) from their air handling unit outside our bedroom window. The phones didn't work so had to walk to reception in our pyjamas in the middle of the night to be greeted by a very unhelpful night manager who wouldn't / couldn't do anything about it. We eventually got given the keys to another bedroom at the other end of the hotel. No apology or any offer of help to move any of our luggage. We asked and received a refund (for the one night only) and would never stay there again. Brighton for a short break was great but not at this hotel!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Good location The breakfast was excellent although we did experience rude guests on the next table who dumped unwanted dirty crockery onto our table when we went up to the buffet table - presumably as there were not enough waiting staff on duty to clear the tables.</Positivereview>

		<Title>The not so grand hotel</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room facilities for a hotel of the statue of the grand were poor. No mini bar or decent tea/coffee making facilities. The breakfast experience was poor, I didn't expect a full self service buffet breakfast with guests queuing to put bread in the toaster. I realise the hotel is very big and catering on a mass scale is a challenge but I would expect more table service at the grand. On the plus side the food quality was pretty good despite being laid out for sometime. I think such an iconic hotel could enforce some standards of dress code in the restaurant areas e.g. Shirts and jackets for the men and no sportswear without guests objecting.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Disappointed that there wasn't a grand dining room to celebrate with Sunday lunch for my husband' s 50th birthday celebrations like the one in Eastboune Grand, and despite the staff being very friendly the service was very slow.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Bedroom was amazing, sea views and a very comfy bed.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Lovely relaxing holiday</Title>
		<Negativereview>A better wardrobe with more hangers would have been nice. The fixed shower over the bath didn't seem to work. The shower on the hose worked but was difficult to control the temperature. A bracket on the wall to hold the shower would have been good so it didn't have to be hand held all the time.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Parking on site (even though it's expensive). Free Wi-Fi worked very well (useful because the data connection to EE is very poor in the hotel) Excellent food. Free Independent newspaper. Service and attitude from all the staff was excellent. Overall a very comfortable and relaxing stay and would definitely recommend to friends and stay there again ourselves.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Great location, very expensive, extra costs!</Title>
		<Negativereview>I would have liked the spa to have been included in the price, what with parking being £30 per night (I stayed two nights in the end). I also wanted to have an early breakfast monday morning, breakfast didn't start until 7am (I needed to leave at 5am) and I could only have a cold breakfast for an extra charge of £5! Needless to say I didn't pay. I am vegan and there was nothing on offer for the dinners and called room service three times, they said they'd call back each time and didn't.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I loved the location, I needed to be at Vegfest which was next door at the Brighton Centre and I ran the half marathon which was in easy reach.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Noisy sleepless night and cynical uncaring staff - an expensive waste of an iconic location</Title>
		<Negativereview>The suite was located directly above the function room which hosted a wedding reception until 1pm. Almost zero sound proofing and we felt like we had joined the party. Very little sleep until late. We had previously advised that we were taking part in the Brighton Half Marathon starting at 8am the following morning. A complaint elicited the the response ' we should have advised you when you checked in' but no offer to do anything about it. They are clearly used to fending off such complaints with a well-worn script. Also it was impossible to use the lobby to meet friends in the afternoon without having booked earlier, as it was full of hen parties and other people not guests of the hotel. Combined with the tired decor of the common areas and cynical staff, a real let down and definitely one to avoid in the future.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The suite was well decorated and spacious.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Power problems due to the roadworks outside, meant fluctuating power. This was explained on arrival and the staff did everything they could to help. The restaurant was shut for the duration, but they did manage a great breakfast to your room and sandwiches as room service.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>A stunning hotel inside and out, with welcoming staff and lovely rooms. Afternoon Tea in the lounge looked very appealing, but I didn't stray. There were power problems but the staff couldn't have done more. I have been before and will definitely go again.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Not so good this time but will return.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Our room was a tad small very stuffy and claustrophobic, just unlucky I guess. Could not turn off the heat or open the window. Should have alerted staff but it was late at night when we discovered this. Spent an uncomfortable night but have not had any problems on previous visits.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Love the Grand for a treat now and then. This visit was a present from my Daughter so was disappointed with our room this time. Otherwise always nice to be there, if there is any criticism it is not with the hotel but the scruffy and unkempt guests! Please bring back some basic rules on dress. Shorts and caps in the restaurant? just takes away the feeling that this is a special occasion and place to be.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Terribly disappointing stay!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Out dated and old and dirty bathroom. Carpets stained, runner on bed stained aswell as bed covers, very grubby. Basic facilities in rooms and not of very good quality. Bed split as two mattresses on one bed frame ....not a comfortable sleep. Room 220...avoid if you book. Lifts, one not working so long wait! Generally I would put this hotel compared to others in Brighton at a 3 star....no more. Staff when told didn't even apologise or offer to do anything apart from would u like to speak to manager on departure, well I had to be somewhere so no time to talk. Also parking first come first basis doesn't really work for people arriving in the evening who are disabled. 30 pound charge is more expensive then the most expensive car parks in Brighton aswell! And more expensive then any other hotel. Very disappointed and will inform others that travel for business and leisure not to stay here. I was on a weekend break with my partner, it was a romantic break. Room did nothing for romantic setting!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Disappointed with the room, pictures online show newly refurbished rooms, very stylish and comfortable. For 152.00 on a Friday I would expect a lot more from a hotel that is called the grand and has a reputation to live up to. No help from reception staff with bags or help to room as a disabled person, not even asked whether help was needed. I write this review having stayed at other establishments in Brighton regularly and wanted to experience the grand. Won't be staying here again as I believe your first experience is tarnished if it does not even meet the basic expectations. I liked that the rooms were spacious...that's all.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The bed was two singles pushed together, due to the depression in the mattresses we basically had a single bed to sleep on. The bath side panel was removed and semi jammed into position as seemingly a temporary measure. Both the lifts were out of order due to constant power cuts and we We're situated on the 6th floor (additionally the phone system was offline, as such I emailed reception on our second night - I never received an responce). Also after being given the wrong timings for breakfast we nearly missed it and had to insist on being aloud in.</Negativereview>

The food is of a good standard but I feel that the gluten free option is poor. Breakfast I found to be set out very poorly indeed. It was not hot it was luke warm due to the fact the food was in none heated containers. Also the eggs where served on muffins so a celiac could not have the option and I was refused an egg because the kitchen did not do this.

		<Title>A lovely romantic treat.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Breakfast is good but could be better in elements. Avoid sitting in the actual room where food is served as the dining room is too vast! For more intimate setting request a table or seat in the bar or terrace area. More options at breakfast would be great.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Outstanding room. Staff were extremely helpful and responded to requests quickly. A lovely venue. A lovely treat! Spend some time in the bar area and conservatory as well</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Had a pasta at about 10:30 in the evening. I must say that it was the most disgusting dish I have ever had bearing in mind the stature and reputation of the hotel. If I was the person managing the hotel, I would rather say sorry, nothing is available rather than serve that kind of pasta.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Poor management at reception. Poor etiquette.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Reception managers lack of class in a building like this just didn't go hand in hand. We arrived to ask for an upgrade which I was willing to pay for as it was our anniversary. The manager popped out from behind a door and said it was £125 extra. I declined then she said, how about £90. We were haggling at the desk very bizarre as when I went for a lower price, the manager turned her back and walked off. So there was an empty room that nobody took in the end as we checked in late. Very poor training and didn't leave a good taste in our mouths upon arrival/checking in. On top of that we had scaffolding outside of our window which we were not told about.</Negativereview>

		<Title>EXPENSIVE CLASSIC HOTEL BUT A LITTLE DISAPPONTING</Title>
		<Negativereview><![CDATA[Lots of tables RESERVED (for Tea) in Victoria lounge for hours with nobody on them. Your bar is NOT big enough to operate this sort of system. Come on The Grand, The Hilton put's a little board on their tables saying you can use this table until 2pm or 3pm (or whatever) No indoor swimming pool like the Hilton next door. Some rooms are noisy. Double glazing needs to be 3/4 inch not 1/2 inch Had to go to the Hilton for the Valentines dinner and Lunch as the Grand didn't do any special meal with entertainment. Bar and lounge area too busy at weekend evenings and they wont open the regency room as they did at Xmas. So we and others went to the Hilton Bar & lounge, although cost is not the issue drinks are a 1/3 rd cheaper at the Hilton]]></Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Good king-size sea view room, but you have trade this off against road noise. Double glazing bit below par. Excellent service but no fridge @ £300 per night</Positivereview>

		<Title>Avoid if you can.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Hardly any wardrobe space to speak of. Bathroom had mould in the shower and was poorly maintained. Tea and coffee facilities were what you would expect in a TravelLodge etc. Only one, very expensive, restaurant in such a large hotel. Only one lounge area to speak of, which being part of the reception did not make it a relaxing place to sit. Stairs carpet frayed and in places could prove a significant trip hazard. Most members of staff, except for the restaurant, very rarely greeted us and the reception staff deliberately failed to acknowledge guests unless expressly approached. This is not acceptable in a 4 star hotel which charges way above average.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Could do a lot better</Title>
		<Negativereview>Staff ignored us when we got out of a taxi on a freezing cold wet and windy day. They ignored myself and my daughter again when we had hauled our bags inside the small front door and we had to carry our big heavy bags up the steps ourselves. I had pre-arranged to check into our room at 1pm specifically, and was told when I finally got to the check in desk that there were no rooms available until 3pm, at which point I stood my ground and explained that I had asked for a 1pm check in specifically. After I emphatically said this, a room magically became available straight away-this kind of staff attitude is not what travellers from overseas (or domestic) want-we want proper attentive service at such a "grand" hotel.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Lovely old but renovated hotel with seafront location (n.b.not ideal in a very wet and cold winter though-much better in summer I am sure)</Positivereview>

		<Title>Lovely hotel but service not great when busy</Title>
		<Negativereview>The hotel was very busy when we stayed as it was the 1st Jan. When we arrived it was at full capacity for NYE and the rest of the bank holiday weekend. The staff had trouble coping. Firstly we had a bad experience at reception checking in and again checking out which had to be resolved by the duty manager. However it was resolved to our satisfaction. Bar was very busy and no seating available and service was slow. Breakfast had a very long queue to wait for a table. However I'm sure that on an average weekend this would not be the case. No fridge or mini bar in the room.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Lovely grand traditional hotel with a contemporary and comfortable make over. Restaurant and lobby bar has very nice food although you are paying high end prices. Room and bathroom was nice and big and it is well equipped. Great location for exploring the town.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Some of the staff members were rather rude. Had no smile on their faces and were not making effort to make each and every guest welcome. Disappointing. Also our room was quite small and the view - horrible, but since we only paid £92 for one night I suppose this was something to expect. Sea view rooms are above £250, but those are spacious and more beautiful of course. Lastly, breakfast was quite disappointing.. We had it delivered to our bedroom, but it was a little poor...</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The interior is amazing - antique decor looks superb. Especially the piano in the hall. the atmosphere in the evening is very pleasant especially hearing the piano whilst walking in the hotel or sitting down for a relaxation moment - fabulous. The staff was very helpful, not all I must say! some came across rather rude and I didn't like such attitude at all, however staff at the Restaurant - amazing!

		<Negativereview><![CDATA[Few minor things could be improved. For example, the bathroom does not have a heated towel rail or radiator. Hence could feel cold & then had to put towels on the radiator in the bedroom. This is probably too major work to have rectified. However, there wasn't even a bin in the bathroom which is quite unusual for a hotel. Disappointingly, there was a noisy meeting/conference next to our bedroom but as it didn't continue in the evenings, it was tolerable. It seemed impossible to get a pot of fresh/piping hot tea at breakfast. & only would get extra hot water with tea by asking. The lovely large bedroom would be improved by removing the dining table for 4 altogether from in front of the windows & replacing with more comfortable seating, to be able to enjoy the view. Oddly, the dining table was in a completely different style to the rest of the décor/furnishings so it seemed like 'just use this'. All these points are minor but for the price one is paying, one hopes for everything to be faultless.]]></Negativereview>
		<Positivereview><![CDATA[Fantastic location on the sea-front which of course one pays for. The staff were professional & friendly. The size of room was great but this is due to the type of room booked & thus the corresponding price. There will be smaller rooms in worse positions.]]></Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>We loved seeking sactuary in the bar on a wet and windy afternoon. We enjoyed room service in our suite and received great and prompt service. The bed was so comfortable, we felt cocooned whilst the sea thrashed outside and the breakfast the next morning was well organised and delicious.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>This was my 2nd visit to this hotel which has a wonderful relaxing feeling that you experience as soon as you arrive. I love the bar area which is bubbling and busy. However there are many huge sofas so the chances of finding some private space are small but I understand changes are afoot in the new year to change this.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Perfect for an overnight stop</Title>
		<Negativereview>We arrived very late and were greeted with great kindness. We also had to set off early so we had not ordered breakfast. The lad on night duty made sure there was fresh coffee for us at no extra cost. Fantastic service. Tired and tatty ( room, as well as us!) but perfect for overnight stop for an early crossing to France. Excellent value for money</Negativereview>

		<Title>Value for money for short get away</Title>
		<Negativereview>Good value for money. Glad I had a shower though before arriving as water cold! Basic and dated hotel, but for £40 still a good deal. Room had a big comfy bed and all clean and tidy. Check out was too early, 10.30am, though luckily we werent rushed. Great view over Folkestone sea front. Paid extra for breakfast which was not worth the money, so if staying again would go elsewhere to eat. Would recommend for a short cheap get away.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Ok just for a few hours nightsleep</Title>
		<Negativereview>Hotel was dated and dirty and so was room furniture. Space inside lift was tiny even for one person with small luggage. At check-out, staff did not ask if our stay was fine or not; nor interested in an invitation for us to come back.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Great location, although couldn't go down to the seafront as access was closed to the public but the views from our bedroom was fantastic. Breakfast was okay-ish.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Simple, clean, served its purpose perfectly for a quick stopover. Unbeatable i.e. fair price.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Perhaps changing some aging furniture in the room which had seen better days, but this is not a complaint. The price was very low making the stopover more than fair. For the price it cannot be faulted.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>for the price one simply cannot complain. It is a basic hotel not intending to compete with 4 stars. But everything worked and I was able to shower well before continuing on my trip. This was a stopover in order to catch the Eurotunnel train early the next morning, and for that purpose this hotel served its purpose well.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Faded and jaded, and noisy at weekends</Title>
		<Negativereview>I can't speak for the refurbished rooms because we were put in one of the old ones, complete with bumpy mattresses, peeling wallpaper and sloping lino-covered floors. There is a nightclub in the hotel and we were directly above it, albeit at the back, despite having specifically requested a quiet room on our booking. The hotel is clear that there will be music at the weekends, which is why I asked for a quiet room. The request was either overlooked or ignored.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location on the Leas is great. You walk out of the hotel and can see the sea stretching out to the horizon.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The BIGGEST problem is the parking .Limited spaces outside Hotel usually all taken by 4.00pm .Vouchers are available for parking but they are only any good IF you can get a space.Traffic Vultures circle at weekends [sat + sun] and, as I witnessed, take no prisoners they will ticket you if you do not park in aloted spaces.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>All in all a very good place for a few day stop in Folkstone. Rooms are clean ,staff friendly ,if you get a room at the front GREAT VIEW !. A good base to see all that is on offer in surrounding areas ,.Dover Castle for example amongst plenty of choices. Enjoyed our stay .</Positivereview>

Any one booking this hotel should note that the facilities do not reflect the photographs on The Sothcliffee website.</Negativereview>

Rooms were clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. Close to town centre with a good selection of shops, restaurants and bars in close proximity. Breakfast was excellent and waitress very attentive. Being less than 20 minutes from Channel Tunnel, is an excellent location for a day trip to France.

		<Negativereview>* At 6am AND 830pm I wanted a shower (multiple night stay) but found I had to let the water run for 25 minutes before it actually was hot!!! * To use the free wifi, you had to access it only in the lobby!...not convenient. * Requested quiet room - had room above bar...also - someone thought it a good idea to set off fire alarm around 1am. * Made multiple requests that no one enters room and declined service and wanted 'Do Not Disturb' sign (they do not offer this) - they entered and serviced the room anyway * No parking provision - parking is a bit of a nightmare at the location</Negativereview>

		<Title>Very disappointed stay</Title>
		<Negativereview>The place needs a complete overhaul they have painted the reception but need to do something with the rooms.the carpet is not the same all through the stairs mismatched. . The beds were not changed in over a week the beds had blankets and not duvets . Down the side of the beds was filthy I dread to think what was under the beds!! The furniture has seen better days. .you had to ask for milk everyday.. the en suite was a cupboard. The kettle took forever to boil...it was boiling hot in the room that the radiator was turned off and we had to leave the balcony door open at night which was not safe .. I did not stop itching in there that after a week I complained about the bites and they changed our room no problem.. but I carried on itching so checked out 6 nights early. Not been offered a refund and had to pay another £380 to go somewhere better...disgusting... would rather of stayed at the burstin and that is scrapping the barrel..the window did not open in our 2nd room.. the dust on the lampshades was disgusting..place could do with fumigating and gutting..</Negativereview>

This saddens me. I was in the 80's the County Councillor for this area. This was once a wonderful hotel. Something has gone wrong. You need to bring someone in to put the situation right as I do not want to see you go out of business. The ball is in your court so do something about it.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>This hotel is really really in need of some tender loving care. Very poor quality accommodation. No parking meant we had to drive around when we arrived and attempted to park in local underground car park which was very seedy full of drug dealers and speed merchants we just didn't feel safe at all. Some of the clientele were really dodgy and we were woken to violent shouting and swearing at 2am. No phone in room so too frightened to go and ask reception to sort it out. We were in room 27.</Negativereview>

Although the decor was a bit dated i must say the bed was one of the most comfy i have ever slept on.The breakfast was one of the best too. Plenty of choices and the cooked part was very tasty. It was as good as the breakfast offered in other 3 and 4☆ star establishments. I would stay again if in Folkestone.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The hotel is in need of a refit, very few of the rooms have been updated. The majority are poor to very poor. The first room we stayed in was old and in need of a refit. We were moved, at our request, as there were too many stairs and one door opened onto a very small landing with the banister behind it. The second room was a lot better except the mirror was on the opposite side of the room to the one power point. They did load us an extension lead so my wife could dry her hair etc. No hair dryers with the rooms.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I had to leave early on both mornings so couldn't try the breakfast's that I'd paid for.

		<Title>Extortionate prices for a terrible hotel in a good location.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The Check in and Check out process was the worst I have seen at any hotel - the queues went far beyond any designated queuing area and I have no idea how it took such a long time. We were hoping things could only improve after the long queue but we were sadly mistaken. The $15 resort tax applied a night (in addition to all the standard taxes) was disgraceful. It covers Wi-fi and use of the gym next door (not even in the same building). Unsurprisingly, we didn't get a chance to use the gym due to all the sightseeing we had planned so we paid $15 a night for Wi-fi which I'm appalled wasn't included. We were bitterly disappointed at arrival at our room - it was nowhere near as pristine as the clearly carefully taken photos in any advert. In fact, in the first room we stayed in the plugs were hanging out of the walls, and I touched the fridge to find myself on the receiving end of an electric shock. We were moved but the second room wasn't much better in terms of appearance (basic details like an old bath with a rough surface and broken taps really could have been sorted) and the rooms feel old and unclean. There is a limited amount of ceiling light and the lamps are again stiff and old. We did have a good view in this second room but the windows were absolutely filthy so there was limited enjoyment of this (on one side of the hotel, the windows are covered in brown netting which would have made it even worse). The windows were also extremely difficult to open and close which was frustrating. Finally on the room, the fridge had a revolting smell to it (clearly unclean) and ensured that all food placed in it acquired the same foul stench which was disappointing. Our room was described as a 'Superior Room' and so we dreaded to think how bad Standard would have been. However, it turns out that 'Standard' doesn't exist so this is false advertising from the outset.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Horrible check-in and ugly, but great showers and subway friendly</Title>
		<Negativereview>I stood in line *50 minutes* just to get to the check-in counter, at 2:00 p.m on a Tuesday. There were only 4 people at the desk. A little later I noticed the line was even longer, stretching all the way to the door. The hotel corridors and rooms--the brown carpets, the bedspreads, the veneer furniture--were almost studiously ugly. There were two flat pillows--I had to ask for more--and crummy towels.There was no coffee maker. To leave a bag after check-out, you have to buy a $5.00 ticket from the front desk and then bring it yourself downstairs to the unpleasant basement. Because I booked last minute, most hotels were sold out. The $1,200 including tax I paid for a 4-night stay was comparatively "cheap".</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The shower was blissfully hot and strong, the bed was comfortable, and the location couldn't be beat for getting into Brooklyn and around town. There was free wi-fi. The staff was pleasant and efficient.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Terrible. Read reviews before booking.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Almost everything. Overpriced hotel. Terrible terrible room. Cigarette burns on curtains and bed. Old wooden chair unsightly. Bathroom smelt strongly of bleach- I imagine because the shower looked so so bad- cracked floor tiles, yellowed tiles. Dust on all ledges in bathroom. Dirty air conditioner in bedroom. Dark. Little light. Bed full of springs. I was actually concerned there might be bed bugs it was that bad... So I googled and the hotel does have a report of bed bugs, but luckily I didn't get bitten. Will never stay here again.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Very outdated window was left open in room unable to put it down, which led to bugs @ night... furniture was broken along with leg holding sink up in the bathroom...my husband brought it out of the bathroom to show me !! Unreal for the price we paid Central air was barely blowing cold air... we were suppose to have a refrigerator in the room but did not. So after spending 46 dollars for JUST the steak at the hotel restaurant which was extremely delicious but could not eat it all and no frig met wasted steak. Totally NOT happy with this hotel. Was the worst I have ever stayed in !! I cant imagine what the "suites" look like ! .</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I cued over an hour to check-in, but the staff were very nice and helpful. The building is covered in scaffolding and shrouding so looks very drab from the outside and it's worse on the inside - very old and tired decor. The room was warm and quiet, but pealing paint, very old bathroom, worn carpet - very dilapidated and basically worn out. It's a massive hotel with hundreds of rooms so is very impersonal and I didn't feel it was value for money at all - very expensive actually for what you get.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Location and that'</Title>
		<Negativereview>To register in took over an hour, I asked for early check in and was not told there would be a 40.00 charge. The bathroom I was sent to was so falling apart I did not want my daughter to use it or even see it for that would have been a lovely 1st impression.I was so disgusted and disappointed of the condition. When seeing our room I was amazed that the city has not condemned the building. Paint pealing, missing fixtures, walls marked with(?), a window that was so dirty, I think there was a wall of brick behind it that would have been a better view. The bed was sagging, the one chair was stained with filth, the mirror had not been washed, there was chips in the tub, molding etc. I could go on but have better things to tell you. I then went down stairs to check out as I had very little faith in our stay there. The line's were even longer. I spoke with the manager she told me my $ was non refundable. I told her the room was unacceptable. She explained to me that the building. was 100 years old and they were in the stages of remodeling. One of the reasons I picked the building was for the old school class and location. We were given a new room. We pretended to each other that it was OK.... I planed on seeing what I could do later after we saw a bit of the city. At this point I had already wasted to much time in just checking in. This room was clean but still missing knob pieces on the faucet, the air conditioner was not working, I had to plug in the lights, the mirror was not clean and no fan in the bathroom gave the room a moldy smell. When we got back after taking in a bit of the city, the line was down so I waited to straighten out the situation. The man at the desk was so rude. He said he didn't know what I was talking about and walked out and did not come back. I stood there for a bit thinking he may have gone to get a manager. After waiting some time for his return, my daughter came from the room wondering where I was.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Nice price for this location, but that's it.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Poorly kept. The rooms look shabby. No extra luxuries like a second chair (you get only one in a room with two beds), no clock. The windows are dirty. Our window was crooked and would not close for a couple of inches at one corner. The carpeting needs better vacuuming: there was stuff from previous guests on the floor under the bed. Really?.. There was an unexpected and unavoidable extra expense for WiFi - $15 a night!!! Also do not believe the photo of a room on their website. On the bed is a blanket with a sheet.</Negativereview>

Booking.com is a rip off they do not show full price customers will pay up front, and add taxes when too late - and as the room was non-refundable you cannot cancel either (very convenient!). Will NEVER use again.. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone, and certainly paying over £120 pn would expect a better room. Other hotels I've stayed in the same location was much better. Feel like I've been ripped off. I'm not sure how after selecting the lowest rating across the board you managed to get 2.5 rating?? trying to rip me off on my ratings as well..tut.tut shame on you booking.com!!!!!!!!!</Negativereview>

		<Title>Really???</Title>
		<Negativereview>Three things: Checking in there is always a long line! When checking in before 11 pm there was an hour waiting line. Only two clerks were checking people in. Others were walking in and around into a back room, closing out registers...,carrying register drawers??? When booking, why are guests asked for our arrival time if there is no intention to accommodate large numbers who are checking in at different times of the day? The mattress was terrible. Hard, cracking noises when I sat on the edge. Very uncomfortable bed in room 410! The Worst mattress ever! Get rid of it! The window was left open. It took over an hour for someone to come and close it. I could not move it! From arriving before 11:00 pm, I finally got to sleep after 1:30 am- just waiting over 2 1/2 hours for clerks, phone operators and maintenance engineers.... A nightmare!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Although there was a long line for check in, one of the two front desk agents spent 5 minutes just chatting with another employee. Check out was similar with an agent allowing other customers to skip the line. The room itself was generally outdated and unclean - the totally bald carpet was actually sticky so I had to wear shoes. At one point, I called the front desk to ask if there might be a corkscrew I could borrow, not only was I told that such a basic amenity was unavailable, they were not even able to tell me whether or not their store had one. I can't imagine I would be the first with that question. I know this was one of the cheapest hotel options in the area, but you might as well stay in a crappy hostel.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Check-in took nearly an hour, which could have been avoided with more staff. The rooms were outdated and shabby, not in a good way. One particular bell boy (a little old man) was very rude!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location of this hotel is perfect - a couple hundred meters from Times Square, across the street from Madison Square Garden, train station acros the street, which makes it easy access to everywhere!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The rooms are old and for the amount of money you pay it was extremely disappointing. I had hairs in my 'clean' towels. The bathroom is falling apart. Honestly it's a joke I would never stay there again. The photos are completely photoshopped. I understand it's a good location that's basically what you're paying for, but if I did it again I'd stay 10 minute walk or so from the hype and have a better hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Title>May 2016 Stay at the Penn --- OKay !</Title>
		<Negativereview>The Hotel is getting a Facelift room's above the 10th floor were remolded and new again but I couldn't afford one of those , my Room had MAJOR DUST on the Curtain's and the lamp shades.... No Fridge but I could have rented one for $25. per stay, the Old dingy room didn't even have clean window's and No view , It was a basic room with 2 double bed's -OK, desk and TV unit with a Flat SCreen TV, The chipping paint and cracks on all the wall's were bad , the Bathroom was just Terrible, a chipped all over painted tub , and dirty hair form other people on the floor as if the room wasn't even cleaned ..... The Door's looked like Coffin's - they are original to 1919 , that was cool but Erie ! I did not complain about the room because I knew the Hotel was old and IS being updated , I had another issue my last night there and had to speak to the Manager on Duty and he was the nicest guy even after I told him how I felt..... all the staff were really .... OMG is this Hotel busy , Long Lines checking in and out daily , They offer a baggage hold after you check out for $5. a bag , get that info as soon as you check in , also they have express check out where you just drop your door key's into a slot so you don't have to wait in line , make sure you are aware of this , so your not wasting time.. ? is , will I stay here again even with a non updated room ? YES I would ...... We only slept in the room and showered .... Oh and hopefully they leave this but go to the 12th floor just off the elevator to see the original Pantry of the Hotel, it's like a museum behind glass..</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Perfect Location for walking, bus a subway, Just a few block's from Times Square.....</Positivereview>

Allocated to a floor for smokers.(we don't smoke). We Couldn't move, as no rooms were available. Hotel and room dated and tatty. Room service/assistance might just as well not exist. Two flat worn out pillows only in the room. Dirty blankets on bed. The list goes on. The Owners obviously don't care!

The man on the desk swiped my credit card and later he is informing me that there is no availbility for the first night. He should have not swiped. Later i requested them to put me in another hotel for teo nights .. They said they cant as i have to check out from there at 11:00am and check in Pensyllvania Hotel at 4:00pm ... This means i waste my whole day in check in and check out. The man didnt understands anything .. Later after meeting the manager of the hotel .. And waiting for 4 hours i got the room at 3:30am ..

		<Title>Convenient, but not ideal in other ways</Title>
		<Negativereview>It's important to remember the room cost was very reasonable, so it isn't fair to compare it to the Waldorf Astoria, where I'd been staying on business the prior two nights. That would have cost 2x or 3x the rate of the Hotel Pennsylvania. That said, I would have been willing to pay more for a better room at the Hotel Pennsylvania if given the choice. I wondered if booking.com sourced business, where the hotel made less profit, was relegated to the less desirable floors and rooms. If so, my experience might not be representative of the other floors. Floor 16 was the only floor I was on other than the lobby. It had a distinct "old" odor to it from the moment the elevator doors opened. The room itself was in need of a deep clean. The surface stuff was clean, but things like the vents, which are harder to get to, were not real clean. I would probably stay there again for a cheap place to stay if I was traveling solo, but wasn't the kind of place my wife would be excited about.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Many things in this hotel are pathetic, to say the least! 1. No courtesy at check-in. The lady barely spoke 3 words - floor, room number and elevator location. There was no welcome or Hi. No smile. Can't believe hotels in 2016 can run this way! 2. Although the room was big, it's old and untidy. Cracks on walls, old furniture and poor bathroom. 3. There was no coffee machine or microwave.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Location is good as it's near Penn station with all subway lines within 5-minute walking distance</Positivereview>

		<Title>Not worth the money unless you're visiting for an event at Madison Square Garden.</Title>
		<Negativereview>There was excessive noise from pipes in the walls, hallway, and street outside - sounded like someone was banging and rolling logs around on hard floor from inside the walls. The A/C and thermostat didn't work. There was a huge line for checking in. Breakfast was not provided/included.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location and lobby were nice. The shower head provided good pressure and coverage. Checking out was easy and quick - just had to drop the keycards off in a dropbox, but made me uneasy about whether or not we'll get charged since it didn't seem like they were keeping up on people checking out on-time.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Hotel was a little dark inside, lighting subdued, maybe purposefully- some parts looked like they needed a makeover. However did what it says on the tin, value for money in great location.</Negativereview>

		<Title>The Hotel was terrible!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Things that were terrible: It took 1.5 hours to check in at the lobby desk. The hallways were dark and dingy looking. My room - omg was terrible. The bedspread was from the 60's and very dirty.- So ugly. The pillows were flat, the room was dark, not enough light. The bathroom was outdated, the paint was peeling in the bathroom, the walls were dusty in the entire room. The worst part of the room - The ac unit didn't work - it was so hot all night - never got cool - it was like the desert. The room was awful ! I will never stay here again ! never!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The only thing that I liked was the lobby area - that's it. After you leave the lobby - its all downhill after that.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Check in is extremely slow as is check out due to the number of guests and lack of staff on counter who were also very grumpy. Rooms are filthy, ours had drink stains all over one the wall where someone had clearly thrown a drink at it, stains all over the carpets, dirty curtains, dirty paintwork very old and tired decor and poor quality bathroom with bodged sink legs that had been broken. Generally the place is very dirty, had i seen the rooms beforehand i would not have booked this hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Well my first room it was run down the bathroom stunk there were Staines on the blinkats and the plaster was falling off the walls I asked for a different room which was better until I had to ask for better pillows because they weren't even an inch thick! So I called and asked for better pillows and waited 45 minutes for them and called three times while waiting. Finally got to go to sleep and we got up in the morning to find that the fosets on the sinks leaked and the pipes. Were leaking as well we got out as fast as we could than we went to go do breakfast and I went to Check my bank and they took a 100 dollar deposit without telling me!!!! So I called them the first person that answered I told them my problem and they said hold please to transfer you to up front so I held another person picked up told them my problem said I wanted my money back that's person said hold please I'll connect you to the front desk the third person answered and I finally asked are you the front desk and they said yes I told them my problem and said that I wanted my money back and they sold hold please I will connect you to the front desk 4 person picked up and deliberately hung the phone up I will never go back to this hotel it's the worst hotel ever</Negativereview>

They claimed that it was the only room left and they were waiting for someone to come and open it. (Was there miscommunication at the front desk?) I called the security, but by that time the person left. I didn't feel safe in that hotel and the amount isn't worth it. I won't stay here again.

		<Negativereview>The room we had was 2 double beds, so not ideal for 2 teenagers. However, it was best value for that location. Room was a bit tatty - dusty at the edges of the carpet and bathroom a bit battered. We were on 9th floor and the lower floors lift lobbies were better decorated(so possibly rooms too) - but may be more expensive. Noisy at night - but I guess all NY is!!! No drinks facilities in rooms - we like our cuppa!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Excellent location next to Penn Station so easy to carry luggage. 10 mins walk to Times Square. Left luggage at hotel at $5 a bag. Room for 4 was cheap at £120 per night. Very good restaurant/bar attached. Also coffee shop in lobby to get hot chocs before bed.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Never again!</Title>
		<Negativereview>1. I waited over 45 minutes to check in at 2 a.m.; there was a short line and reception chose to serve guest who were behind me in line. 2. I booked a room with a king bed and was given a room with two tiny beds. 3. The radiator did not work. With the ambient temperature in the 40s (deg F), there was no heating in the hotel. 4. The walls were paper thin. I could clearly hear what was being said in the other rooms. 5. I did not feel that the bathroom was clean.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>After discussing my discomfort with the manager on duty, he gave me a solution that was reasonable and fair.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The walls were thin so we could hear people talking in the room next to us, which wasn't great. The room and hotel itself were pretty basic, so not sure it was really worth the money.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>If you want to stay close to the main touristy things in New York then this is hotel is what you're looking for. From here you can walk to Times Square, the Rockefeller, St Patrick's Cathedral, Grand central and more.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Some of the rooms are really run down. My first room had a leaky toilet with a puddle of water on the bathroom floor and trash still in the bins so I was moved. Second room had a bed that was like sleeping on plywood, two very flat pillows, no tub, door latch was broken and the safe didn't work. Fortunately I survived the night. The next day I was given a third room on the 12th floor and finally I was happy. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and the room and furnishings were up to date.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Bedroom farce - Hotel deceived and manipulated us.</Title>
		<Negativereview>On check in, following a 7 hour flight, having complained to the Manager and been shown 5 different bedrooms, we very reluctantly settled on room 1214, which was still very disappointing. We were given an ultimatum, take one of the rooms or make alternative arrangements at another hotel. We were assured we had one of the best rooms in the hotel which was a blatant barefaced lie. All very frustrating and a very bad start to our 8 day stay with them. We had explained this was a special anniversary but that meant absolutely nothing to the manager. We were merely a problem he just wanted to go away.</Negativereview>

Is amaizing. About staff, all people is very kind, specially people of valet parking / security, you can have a nice chat with them when you´re car.

		<Title>Horrible stay</Title>
		<Negativereview>To be honest, everything. We knew the hotel wasn't a new hotel but the room was disgusting. The bathtub was far away from be called clean. Electronic cables were not safely installed by walls : very dangerous! We were tourists so we were away most of the time but didn't feel like to spend lot of time in the room. We DO NOT recommend this hotel even the price looks more interesting and the location is great. The location is not everything. As this hotel is huge, staffs were always busy and were not willing to assist. One more thing made us surprised was that we needed to pay 5$ per luggage in order to leave at the hotel after check out!!!! We have never seen hotels like this one. We will plan to go back to New York next year but we never want to return here. 日本人の方へ 例え宿泊費が安くてもこのホテルはお勧めできません。部屋はとても古く清潔とは言えません。快適な宿泊を探- されてる方は別のホテルに宿泊されることを強くお勧めします。</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Nothing! When they restore it completely, and do it right with the space they have, it could easily develop a reputation</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I liked everything about it! It's a classic NY Hotel! Doormen, the works! Top floor could be a Fabulous Ball Room and Conference Center if updated! A beautiful chandelier hangs at the entrance and if an interior designer would complete the room, which is huge, could be used for banquets, weddings, meetings, parties, conference center, etc. The view from all four sides is spectacular. I really got excited upon view! I hope this gets passed on to Management, because the location and size of the building is ideal! Prime! The basement could be used as a fine Restaurant, and the main floor empty space could make a fine lounge area with bar. Considering the year it was built, a Titanic theme smoking lounge design, with mahogany walls, mother of pearl inlay, and leaded glass would be exceptional. This hotel and it's service could become the talk of the town!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Too much time waiting in the line for reception!!! Especially for check-in/ check-out time they would need to arrange a second desk like the one they have, it's not all right to wait 45 mins- 1 hour in the queue!! I wanted to buy the ticket to leave my bag in the deposit on the next day but at check- in and during the evening with less queue they told me they had no ticket so I had to stand in the line at check-out other 30 mins at check-out just for this ticket! The hotel is quite old and not really comfortable, but for a cheap and short stay is a good solution.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Poor Service, waiting long hours in order to check in. Poor rooms, bad condition.</Title>
		<Negativereview>They do not care that was a long line waiting to check in, the check in counter start with 4 persons when we arrived there, but they all left and check in counter was empty, no one service us. After a long while they finally have one person came out to help us, but the person has such a sour face, no smile, I wonder why this hotel management put some one like that to be helping customers. another thing is when they post Superior Double beds, it does not give you two double beds. It will give you one king bed. This is they way they explained. Even though we do not agree, but they said this is the way it means. As we have booked 2 rooms for total of four persons, we really need d two double beds, we end up has to pay extra $75.00 per room in order to be able to get 2 double beds. Another joke is, even we want to make the change, the check in counter person said he cannot make the change unless I spoke to the manager. He said we need to go to the room and than dial "0" . After we insisted to speak with the manager which he finally spoke to us and authorized the check in person to change and let us to have double beds with extra pay. It is amazing that the manager pretend didn't see that was such a long crowd waiting to check in, he went right back to his back office and continue let one person helping the waiting line. It took us two hours to check in on that night!! By the way, the room they gave us were very bad condition, the LoJack was broken, no hair dryer.</Negativereview>

		<Title>The train left long ago</Title>
		<Negativereview>I paid for additional charges such as health club fees that were not advertised or refundable. The room was horrible. A broken outlet right next to the bed, no drain for the tub, stains on the wall, an ignored internet request for extra pillows which was also ignored after calling the desk, window shades with holes in them that didn't fully close anyway and an extremely outdated and noisy air unit added up to a VERY unpleasant stay.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The best thing about this hotel was the location. It is directly located across from Penn Station ( we took the train ), and is, therefore, within walking distance to almost anything.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Need to better maintain facilities in the room (TV, lights, lamps, power outlets, hot water etc.) to make sure they run well and in good condition. I stayed for 4 nights, left for another city for 2 nights, and back for 2 more nights. They did not provide overnight luggage storage. Should be something they provide as a service - either for free or charge for it. Security guards could be more active in making sure homeless in front of hotel do not bother the hotel guests who are waiting for a cab or standing in front of the hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Not very good hotel on good location.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Staff at sevice/reception desk is not very service minded at all and has rather unfriendly manners! Gigantic hotel with scaringly long queues for checking in - or any other contact with staff. No information desk proper. Extra $5 per piece (!) charged for storing luggage over day after checkout. (They even charge you for using the restroom when you pick up the luggage). Dark and dull rooms.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is very good as for the easy access to all means of transport: Four subway lines accessible within the distance of one block, busses up and down 7th ave, Penn Station across the street. Direct trains Penn St - Newark L Airtrain St. Direct buses Penn - Jamaica JFK Airtrain St. Particularly sweet and friendly cleaning and tecnical personnel.</Positivereview>

We had to get angry for them to finally release the room. They did take money off our final bill in compensation though and apologised.</Negativereview>

Room was extremely dirty, there was a bunch of M&m candies scattered on the floor, someones bobby pens,It was a little cold at night, so we wanted to turn the heater on but the thermostat knob was broken, also the switch on the lamp was broken too, we had to bend down under the bed to turn the light off, also the bathtub all chipped. And I am even not talking about the view. I know, it's not the fault of the hotel but it was nasty. BTW the room # was 587.I took all pictures and never stay there again. Very cheap rooms. At least a tiny coffee maker for 1 person would be very affordable for the owners to have, if they do not want to spent any penny for the renovation.]]></Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>From the moment you walk in the hotel is very dated, I stayed here 12 years ago and thought it was very nice, so I returned to see that not one thing had changed since 2004! The receptionist hardly spoke English, the first room I had was the size of a prison cell, so I had to pay $25 on top of the $135 I was already paying a night to upgrade, but the upgraded room I got was disgusting the beds had stains on the sheets had holes in the bathroom had dirt, grime, hair on the tiles bath was disgusting with stains and paint chipped off the bottom of it, sink was loose and cracked, neither bath or sink had a plug (waited 2days for maintnece to bring us one) bugs under the bed, along with previous stayers fast food containers! My advice is find somewhere else this is a very disgusting hostel sorry I mean hotel!! 👎🏻👎🏻 not quiet sure how booking.com came up with a ratin of 3.3 I wouldn't even give it a 1!!! Disgusting!!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>No...wash cloths, blankets/bedspread, air conditioning or fan, no hair conditioner...(only 2 shampoos). The lack of attention to details shows they are not in the hospitality business, which for some people is fine, but not for me. Will stay at the Affinia Manhattan next time.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Ok....but only for one night as a stop over. No luxury here.</Title>
		<Negativereview>I had to change room twice because the windows didn't close properly and were draughty. The heating also didn't work in two of the rooms. Rooms 1212 and 618a were the rooms I changed from. Room 1240 was ok, but pretty sparsely decorated and had no bedspread.</Negativereview>

The chessboard-style black and white tiles in the bathroom look funny :p. 5. The comforters look dodgy.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>1. The location is FANTASTIC. 2. Bedroom and bathroom are cleaner than expected, but the comforters look rather dodgy... we didn't dare to sleep underneath them. 3.

The Double room had only a single bed with 1 pillow without a pillow case. The room was dirty with hand prints and marks everywhere. The bathtub had bern painted but had chipped off paint. The shower head just stuck out of the wall. Mold on the ceiling. The staff was not helpful except the porter.</Negativereview>

		<Title>No frills hotel in great location</Title>
		<Negativereview>The check in queue was so long took at least an hour, about 6 staff on desk but it was a nightmare. I did arrive st Patrick's weekend, I got there at 11am once queued the staff member was great and I paid 5dollars for them to hold my case until check in time 15:00 so this allowed me to go off for the day. You take your case downstairs to a luggage hold area. On return only one guy down there and again more queuing. The room was ok but no safe box to put valuables and the bed mattress was so uncomfortable really hard. I managed for the 2 nights I was there and for short stay sure it will be fine. No tea/coffee in the room.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location was great, the staff were friendly, helpful. It was a budget hotel I was only there to sleep as out all day so it was fine for me. The hotel room was clean and tidy. There were facilities in the hotel to use coffee area, restaurant to grab something to eat if you want to. The bus/subways all close, and there's coffee shops around Starbucks, Tim hourtons. Empire State walking distance and Maddison sq opposite. If you need somewhere to rest your head at good price no frills this will be ideal, I would stay here again if it was a short stay visit.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Not pleasant.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was awful. The corridor leading to the room was awful. It was dark and dated and dirty. I was glad we had stayed in another hotel previously so that my children have a good memory of NYC Hotel. The staff member with the title of Bell Captain was the rudest person I have ever met in the service industry. I would seriously question why this man deals with the public. The staff on the reception were pleasant but under staffed and under pressure. Be warned this is an enormous hotel and no special treatment is possible. There were insufficient pillows and towels in our room and the bathroom was depressing. Clumps of dust and rust were visible on the fixtures and fittings. We were charged an early check in fee of $35 as we got to the hotel at 12.30 and check in wasn't until 3. That wasn't an issue with the previous hotel we stayed in. We were also charged $5 per item of left luggage the previous day after we checked out, again this wasn't an issue in the previous hotel.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is excellent. A stone's throw from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The two staff members working in left luggage way down in the basement of the hotel were witty and pleasant and a breath of fresh air compared to the other stressed and unfriendly staff members we encountered at Pennsylvania Hotel.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Bad customer service outweighs good location</Title>
		<Negativereview>The reception staff were really unhelpful; when we first checked in (after waiting seven hours) we were given a room key, when we opened the room door, other hotel guests were in the room, they stated that they only checked in yesterday and definitely still had the room, when we went back to reception the staff member who gave us the room key didn't apologise and just asked if we were "sure people were in the room" or did we "hear voices". We also had to pay a deposit of $100 upon checking in, which we were not told about during our booking or confirmation emails. There wasn't enough info about check in times in confirmation emails, if we knew we would have had to wait seven hours until we could check in we would have booked a later flight. Finally, the main reason as to why I absolutely will not recommend this hotel to any of my contacts is because upon checking out of the hotel (not enough staff on reception which meant waiting in line for a good 60 minutes) a man pushed in front of us when we were at the front of the line, after complaining about this the man started to verbally harass and threaten us very loudly in front of reception staff. He made statements such as "I will **** you up" and "I'm going to call my friends down here to smack you stupid *****'s" as well as "I'm going to ****inf get you". Instead of asking us if we were okay the staff member checking us out handed over our bill, took money for us to use the luggage hold and then said "thanks" whilst the man continued to threaten us. We were obviously really shaken as a result of this man standing a few feet away threatening to physically assault us. All of the staff on reception ignored the situation and we had to request the receptionist to call security, who took the man ten feet away from us, which meant we could still hear him screaming abuse at us.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location was great, everything in central Manhattan was a short walk away, luggage hold staff and housekeeping staff were very friendly, room was adequate</Positivereview>

		<Title>It is not a hotel it is very tall non service guest house.</Title>
		<Negativereview>I am little surprised you call it a hotel. What hotel stuff does it have. It is just room in good location. It is like a huge guest house. There are no services, so what services are you talking about. Every staff member is arrogant to the core. Front office does not pick their phone, operator says there is nothing she can do if front office does not pick up phones. Which service hotel has a standard of not picking phones even after 40 rings. A guess cannot talk to any one. Even in house guests have to go down and stand in huge lines for a small queries. Bathrooms are dirty with broken old useless showers. Internet router goes off for three days, complain after complain to third party provider, who does not care to fix and tells your guest, yes we have remotely checked it and there is a problem so we have shut it down. In four days they do not replace it or fix it. Is it your guest job to coordinate with your service provider. No one at your hotel is even bothered to call back and ask if all is ok or to take it on with your provider. It seems like head less operations and working on auto pilot. No one is interested to provide any service. They all make you feel that they are doing a favor to guest. Pathetic. Has anyone visited toilets close to baggage rooms in basement. Worst and dirty. Seems like there is no management at your hotel. I guess you have realized you do not need to as you have great location so people will come on their own. So why waste sending all these survey forms. This is for hotels running like a hotel. I was highly disappointed.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>location is good but not so great over look their over all service. There is nothing to talk about - just come stand in huge lines to check in go to your room which has nothing except beds and a tv and crappy bathrooms . with internet that does not work and staff that does not help or talk.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>We booked on the proviso that we would have access to the Club 500. We paid for this service and the King club room, thus a continental breakfast and other services. The 500 club had closed on January 2016, we found out when we checked in on 6th April. The room was small and clearly substandard and and not a king club room, something we have been allocated on our 3 previous visits. After a complaint on both counts we were given another room. The fact that the club 5000 had been closed in January, yet we were booked for this service is most disappointing as as well as the initial room allocation.</Negativereview>

Does that mean I can charge you $40 back because I couldn't check in on time and wasted an hour of my valuable time in NYC standing in a line that could've been avoided if you had let me check in early for free?

		<Negativereview>You get what you pay for. Very utilitarian. I think I was right next to a housekeeping closet so that was a bit noisy. Some small repairs needed to the bathroom sink and the bedside lamp. But honestly it was a great clean place to crash. Leave time to check out if you don't want to use the express check out cause the line gets loooong.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The price was right and you can't beat the location! All I needed was a clean place to crash fro 2 nights and this works just fine. Hardly any wait for the many elevators.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>They lost our car, then expected us to go over to the parking garage of many floors to find it ourselves. I refused to do so. They found it after one hour. I went online to change my room charge from my Visa to my American Express before arrival, and it was acknowledged. Yet, they charged my Visa anyway, and charged my American Express. Upon leaving, they did not release the $100 security deposit. The card keys we were given for the room did not work, the second set did not work, and a security guard with a white card had to come up and open our door, then our card worked, and the security man made a nasty remark as he left. The rugs had large stains. The room did not have air conditioning and we were told to open our 16th floor window, which would not budge. The room was dirty. At check out, there were 100 people in line being served by two people. It was a cattle call. I will not ever stay at this hotel again and I will share my experience with my many friends.</Negativereview>

Then when we walk into the room it stank, the bathroom was dirty and clogged, we ask a few staff member to check on it , they said it wasn't they job, and the next morning we ask the cleaning lady she said we didn't ask on time, it definitely the worst hotel experience</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The place has 'no soul'. The staff I dealt with at the front counter didn't seem to have the energy to smile or show enthusiasm about their jobs or life itself...and they are the front line people, there to create the 'first impressions'. The bathroom in our room was super OLD and overall the place could use some major refreshing! We chose this place for its affordability so we can't expect it to be plush by any means, however...in time, this place will need an injection of $$$ to get up to par.</Negativereview>

They were now booked up because the "rates were lowered " for the night. So..... I had the reservation , others booked after me, got better rates, and I had a disgusting filthy room. If I was alone on this trip I would have left and found another hotel, however, I was traveling with my daughter and had to keep her safety in mind. I have called the hotel to register my complaints again, I was told they have no record of my complaints that evening. Very sad, poorly run hotel. Do not stay here!!!! Ever!!! I would welcome booking .com to contact me .... But I don't think anyone reads these reviews or cares .</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The room was filthy. A large burn on the filthy rug. No hot water. I brought a bug home in my suitcase. I complained to the manager about the room and was told there was no where to move me to. I am filing a complaint and want my money back. I took pictures of the disgusting room I was in, of course, looks nothing like the rooms on the website. I have called the hotel and am getting a run around. I have never in my life stayed at such a filthy place.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Will Never Stay at Hotel Pennsylvania Again!!</Title>
		<Negativereview>This looks like a great hotel from the outside. Well, that is where it ends! It took over an hour to check in. The line was so long. Every time we walked through the lobby, there was a line. They seem to not have enough staff to take care of the customers.We got to our room which was the Penn 5000 Level and supposed to be nicer; it was not!! It was a terrible room. It is so old and things were dirty. The bathroom was gross, and the shower leaked all over the floor. When it came time to use the shower, it was either freezing cold or burning hot. The TV remote did not work as well. I will never stay there again. It is true what they say, "You get what you pay for". I will spend some more money next time and stay at a better place. This is unfortunate since it is so close to MDG. This place needs a complete overhaul of renovations.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>This visit we were not happy with it at all. The hotel itself is nice and uaually clean, staff is polite. When we got to our room (1722A) it smelled clean, like bleach (which I dont mind) but the ceiling had something funky going on. It was pealing above the TV, the remnants of such were all over the floor behind the TV so they didn't vacuum back there. The window sills were covered with dirt. And the bathroom looked like it may have had mold in the shower or it is so aged that the grout needed to be redone. Actually the entire yellow bathroom needed to go. I realize that this is an old hotel and I actually loved its 1900s charm in the past. But on previous stays the rooms were at least clean. When we said something to one of the workers there they stated that "that floor was recently closed bc they are in the scheduled for remodeling. They must have opened it up bc their greedy" Idk if id go back here. Although it was a decent price with early early check in total of $200 i like my health better!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I have stayed in this hotel multiple times. This hotel is very convenient to Penn station. And in the past we have loved it. Not the newest hotel in NYC but perfect for our needs.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The hotel is grubby, the staff were very unpleasant, unhelpful and rude. For the money we paid, it was very over priced I think. Queuing for ages to get checked-in after a long flight was a nightmare and the reception staff were inefficient in doing so. It was demanded I give my credit card details, and when I said I didn't have a credit card, the diminutive vitriolic receptionist just kept saying over the top of me, "I need a credit card ma'am" without listening to any explanation. Would never in a million years recommend this hotel. The icing on the cake were the toenail clippings on the bedroom carpet. Disgusting!!!!</Negativereview>

( THE HOTEL IS COVERED WITH SCAFFOLDING...) I was forced to take this dirty room with flies in the bathroom, baseboards and carpets ( room 624A) that have not been cleaned since Nixon was in office...and the shower pan that was so dirty that my girlfriend refused to stand inside without shoes on. My initial complaint, upon arrival was addressed by the hotel offering and upgrade ?? to a closet that did not have enough room to freely walk around the bed. After the jackhammering, I was offered a re-modeled room on the 12 floor that was better...BUT HAD NO DRESSER FOR CLOTHING..I lived out of my suitcase...Truly a disaster.</Negativereview>

		<Title>DO NOT EVER BOOK THIS HOTEL. Save yourself !</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was awful. Nothing as described on booking.com!! Had to change my room within 2mins of entering and the second room issued happened to be as bad, so we gave up! There was a foul damp smell in both the rooms. All the trims in the room from the door handles to lamps were rusty. The bathroom was in a bad state as well ! The sink would get choked within 10seconds of running water and when we asked the operator for maintenance - he reached our room only on the second day of our trip after numerous calls . We spent most of our time outside the hotel (even when we were exhausted) so that we don't have to go back to that rusty smelly choked room and checked out 6 hrs before our flight, since waiting at the airport would be a better option (yup SIX hours before a flight - that's like my personal best). In the end to add salt to my burns, my credit card was charged TWICE for the exact same amount- once upon check in and the second time a day later after I checked out and had reached my destination 9000miles away, when I called the hotel to raise this concern I was asked to call on a weekday between working hours (Sat-Sun). Can you believe it ??? Worst experience ever !</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Checking out of this hotel ! I've lived in a lot of hotels and this was so bad soooo bad that checking out of it put a smile back on my face !</Positivereview>

The bed was too small, the shower altered continuously from cold to burning hot and there wasn't a real breakfast (breakfast coupon gave you a coffee, pastry and orange juice at a kiosk in the hotel; actually cheaper to buy there directly than paying extra for breakfast).</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I'm not generally one to write reviews, but my experience in this hotel was the worst I've ever had. I was in town for a wellness conference and paid for a non-smoking room. I was placed in a room that reeked of cigarettes. When I called downstairs for assistance, I was rudely told that there was nothing that could be done. On my third day, I came back to the door of my room wide open - needless to say, I checked out early and will not be returning to this hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Old hotel but very well located !</Title>
		<Negativereview>we wanted to stay an extra night but one the staff was not very helpful and the other one was not helpful at all, even rude to us. We decided to came back to the front desk later that morning hoping to talk to somebody else y that staff helped to arrange an extra night even though we had to switch room. The hotel should a better system in place when one has to purchase a ticket to put luggage in storage. The hotel was very busy at the time and we had to wait behind another 20 people or more trying to check in just to buy a ticket to store our luggage. Maybe give the other small desk the ability to sell those tickets. if they are making a huge amount of money out of storing luggage (US$5.00 /pc) at least make more it more time efficient.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>very well located, across the street from Madison Square Garden and 4 blocks from Times Square. Subway station just right there. Maria "B" was at the front desk was very friendly and helpful and she made a difference in our overall experience at the hotel. If i come to the hotel, I will for sure look for Maria. She is in the right kind of job, she likes people and make you feel welcomed.</Positivereview>

Had to get a key from the lobby desk to use the restroom in the basement when we went to pick up our stored luggage. Would be nice is there was some kind of breakfast offered even for a minimal charge.

		<Title>Horrible hotel. Nice staff. Don't waste your money.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The rooms were a disaster. We were moved to 3 rooms within 3 hours because of the poor conditions of the rooms. The first room had no working heater and it took an h our and a half of my husband calling and going up and down between our room and the front desk, before we were moved; it all started at 9 pm. We were then moved to a room with no running water. Finally by 11:30pm, we were moved into a suite...that was freezing. Luckily, they were able to get the heaters going. What started off as a great first day in New York was destroyed by the horrible accommodations. We weren't in bed until 12:30am. Their slow response time was due to several other complaints with other rooms they were dealing with throughout the hotel.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location was great. Just a few blocks from Time Square and right next to the subway for exploring all of New York. The staff was very helpful despite the below standard accommodations. They tried their best to find us an acceptable room. The cost of the stay should have been fully compensated for all of our trouble but it wasn't.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>No breakfast option, the bed is very outdated with a thin blanket worn out and much too big and too heavy bedspread. Under the bed is covered with a thick layer of dust. The room is in a totally outdated broken condition. So are the bathroom / shower as well. However, there is plenty of hot water. The tub is are sealed shut in several places with putty. My conclusion is that this hotel despite it standing in a good location, it is far too expensive. The next time I definitely choose a different hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Horrible guest services, rude and unhelpful staff, room was filthy, pubic hair in bathroom shower and sink, bugs all over bathroom ceiling, tiles falling off the wall in bathroom, no towels or clean linen on bed, room smells of cigarette and marijuana smoke, no air conditioning in entire building. Offered HD tv with outdated tv in room. Horrible hotel and services would never stay again or recommend this hotel to anyone.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Messed Up From Reservations to Checkout!</Title>
		<Negativereview>From the start, reservations was bogus, the online services are conflicting to the hotel computer system. Front desk ask for total cost+room deposit $397.00+$100. These charges was charged on my credit card hours after completing the online reservations. It was truly the worst experience i've had booking and booking out of the hotel, and they told me i owed $201.00 at checkout, when I was due the room deposit $100. They need a hospitality/Customer Service training and a new website that's compatible with the house systems. NeedaFixALL make over!</Negativereview>

The rooms look nothing like the pictures online. The bathtub was dirty and rusty. The sheets were old and dirty. The walls were stained the carpet was stained the heater wasn't working and it looked old and dirty. The hotel looke like the one from American Horror Story Hotel version.

		<Negativereview>Our room was a non smoking room on the 11th floor, when we arrived our entire floor and room smelled terrible like ciagarttes and there was an ash tray in our room. When I called the front desk nothing was done about it. Our room was incredibly dirty, the walls and floors were disgusting. The water was a disaster every time we turned it on it went everywhere and it was either scorching hot or freezing cold. Every time we took a shower the entire bathroom floor was covered in water. We got muffins from the coffee shop downstairs and they were old and stale. Our window shades were also full of holes letting light in. Our tv and remote didn't work and the fridge was off. Pictures online are not accurate at all.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>It usually has long queue for check in. I was waiting nearly 1hr just waiting for check in. During the night were lack of staffs. There were only 3 and more than 20 r waiting for assing rooms. You have to ask staff for invoice as he/ she won't say to you when u check in. The cleaness of hotel should be improved however, it is not bad to other 3stars hotel. It's worth with value I paid.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Excellent location, it's only 10 mins walk to Times Square. Empire states building is just nearby. Penn station is just front of hotel. Easy to connect every attractions in New York.</Positivereview>

The officer was flip and spoke to me like I was an idiot for not calling right away ( I waited over a week as I was sure I lost the item at the airport). He added insult to injury- I'm already upset I lost a diamond stud earring with incredible sentimental value, didn't need to be insulted as well and told that I most likely didn't value the item I lost since I waited so long to call.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Would not permit early check in at 2:00 without $40 extra charge (check-in is listed at 3:00). Would not take baggage check without charging $5 PER BAG. Indifferent attitude of desk staff- repeatedly told, literally, "those are the hotel rules I just work here". Bedding consists of clean sheets and a thin blanket. Twin beds had thin, economy matresses- woke up stiff as a board. NO comforter, as stark and minimal as you can get. Hair dryer and iron stuffed in the closet, as well as a little safe. Flat screen TV and radio.Granted it was a room built in the forties, maybe, but could have been made more comfortable. Extra charge for business center (to print out my boarding pass next morning) because it is run by a separate company? Even charged for Wifi!! Very unwelcoming and while entrance and lobby are beautiful, the accommodations and staff made me feel like I was at a roadside motel in southwest Texas in the 70s. And I paid $240 a night for this?? Never again.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Rip Off AVOID!</Title>
		<Negativereview>The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. The room was the size of a postage stamp, and the bathroom looked like it had been installed during the original building! It was shabby and run-down. For the quality, the price is a total rip-off. It was one of the most expensive hotels on my trip and I was staying at Hiltons and Wyndhams (during an event, no less!) in other cities, and it was just rubbish. I would never stay there again and would advise others against it. On the day of check out, I was caught in an hour-long check out line, which completely ruined my plans for the morning and meant that I barely made my flight.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The bath was deep and hot, and it was right across the street from Penn Station and handy to the subway for all my touristing needs.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>This hotel needs updating and new linens. The pillowcase did not even cover the pillow, there was some sort of white stuff on the floor by the radiator. The staff at the desk is curt and not friendly. The daily rate is very overpriced...especially after all the taxes! The lobby needs to have more security as to who is allowed in the lobby.

		<Title>worst hotel I ever been</Title>
		<Negativereview>The worst hotel I have experienced in my life (I'm a frequent traveler) * In the 1st room we had, there was extremely loud heater and it was too dirty – I asked for change * In the 2nd room we had, there was used and not clean bedding, constantly running water in bathroom and it was dirty too * After one night we changed the hotel and didn't stay there. We had booking, which can't be canceled. After seeing the pictures they returned to us only 1/2 of what we paid. * You have to pay for many things which other hotels have as standard features - in summary it's not cheaper comparing to other hotels in the area (e.g. Internet, storing your luggage after checkout etc.)</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Only one bedside lamp and a poor light on the dresser. The bedspread was torn, The bed was tired and there was no light coming in the very tiny window partially due to scaffolding. There was no hair dryer. In order to check in or make other arrangements at the check-in desk, one had to wait for at least 30 to 45 minutes as there were only two people on duty most of the time I was there.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Hotel Pennsylvania Review.</Title>
		<Negativereview>To be perfectly honest, I had an idea of what I was getting into when I booked HotelPennsylvania as I had read all the terrible reviews regarding filthy state of rooms and unfriendly staff (all true I'm afraid). The pictures showing bright and airy rooms have obviously been photoshopped as our room was dirty, dark, dreary and very dated. There was a 20 year old t.v and we had NO fridge. The bathroom sink had a massive crack in it. This hotel really needs to address the hygiene issues and update decor. Anyway, if you can deal with all that and take the view that you'll only be spending sleeping hours there, it's a relatively cheap hotel in a fantastic location so spend your money on the sights, tour excursions, shopping and nice food/eateries.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The only good thing about the hotel was the free WiFi and the location. Bang opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. Macys a minutes walk, shops and eateries all in same avenue. Empire State Building just 5 minutes walking distance and Times Square a mere 15 minute walk away.</Positivereview>

Sheets in bed were changed daily, fresh towels daily and room tidied every day.Bed was massive, and I'm 19t 7lbs. What more did wee want, staff were friendly aswell.

Also the included parking that was on the site was a lie had to pay an extra 106 dollars for two nights parking. This is the first hotel that i have ever stayed at in NYC that did not included parking so unless it is a last resort i would not reccomend staying here. I know my wife and I will not. Also the air coditioning in room was broke witch in combination with the uncofortable bed was quite unpleaseant thank god it wasnt august.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>overall very happy with hotel and staff were very courteous especially George on reception would definitely return ok not pristine like a 5 star but was value for money and clean. A kettle in room would have been lovely My 17 year old daughter was not allowed use the pool in the offsite gym. we were told she would have to be 18. We were too busy mostly to use it but one evening having walked all day sightseeing we wanted a relaxing swim and were refused admission in the Bally centre because my daughter is 17, I would have understood a refusal to use weights but saying a 17 year is too young to use a swimming pool is crazy.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Location excellent, room was clean, comfortable, bed was huge, had a fridge which was handy. Paid an extra service charge with booking.com. Charge was I think $15 a day but for this we got free phone calls from room, internet access, and access to an offsite gym. Was excellent value for money. room cleaned and bed changed daily</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Dirt and dust around the whole room, pug sockets held onto the wall with sellotape, toilet seat coming of, shower wall rotting away, heating and cooling controls didn't work. Dirt and dust gave me puffy eyes every morning. So called breakfast was a pastry, orange juice with coffee even though they didn't have decaf coffee. No seating in cafe where so called breakfast was served. Overall hotel completely run down and never been updated or maintained since the early 1900's. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, it had a highly negative impact upon my holiday and will be seeking compensation as my bill at the end was over $800.00 instead of the $540 it was booked for.</Negativereview>

		<Title>I loved my stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania!</Title>
		<Negativereview>One thing was the shower was too short. Me and my boyfriend are tall and it could not reach our heads.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The beds were pretty comfortable. We had a tv and a desk and drawers. a closet and ironing board and a blowdryer. the washroom was good. You just can't beat the location. Quiet, comfortable and we had a view of the Empire State Building. Right outside was Madison Square Gardens. A short walk away is Grand Central Station and Times Square. We had an absolutely great time and staff was especially helpful and Flora was the best (front desk).</Positivereview>

		<Title>The hotel'</Title>
		<Negativereview>I think that the hotel was under renovation when we went so there were some repairs being made to some parts of the hotel. Our room had stains on the carpet which made it looked dirty but overall it's an ok hotel, not the best but its location more than made up for it.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel's location was excellent. It was directly opposite the Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building is only a few blocks away. There are loads of shops/ places to eat around the area. It is near Penn Station which connects you to loads of destinations via subway. It is also within walking distance to Port Authority and Times Square!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Dirty Shower broken (really, it leacked the whole week!) Enormous line at checkin and if you arrive too late they might not have the room booked What they call "working area" corresponds on fact to one chair... By itself... If you happen to have loud neighbors, insonorisation if bad</Negativereview>

		<Title>Old hotel, uninterested service from staff, but a good sleep.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Staff was a little bit rude while doing the check in. We requested the manager at the moment but she denied it and was arguing back to my wife. I do not know if they were right or not at the end of the short stay. According to Booking.com as a Genius Status with them you get specific treats that the hotel opted-in at some point. This hotel was suppose to give 2 hours late check out priority for genius status. They denied it and I accepted it. After reading about the gifts offered to booking geniuses I believe they did wrong, but most of it was the uninterested feeling overall at the check in desk. The hotel itself is really dated, hallways, elevator, room doors and rooms. To use their luggage storage service you need to queue at the front desk to pay and get tags for your bags. Find this service slow, when all of this could be in a separate queue for people that only need to store the luggage and not check in or out to the hotel (or other services). They also charged me a no show fee, which I pointed out and then they had to refund it. I need to verify that the charge was cancelled. We also needed to print some tickets, and the business office facility was a mess, with no staff a machine with a lot of card on the table. Need to figure out yourself to put money to one of those cards. We end up with the card credit of 3USD that we didn't use and there was no evident way for a refund. Overall the hotel let us down a little bit. Not sure I would recommend it.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is good. It is in front of the Madison Square Garden, and there is a buy metro and train station right there. We had a good sleep after all.</Positivereview>

Once you step out of the elevator the carpet is dirty, the walls are dirty, the ottomans are dirty, the place smells the shower curtains had mold on them.

		<Title><![CDATA[OK hotel, more negative than positive BUT ITS CLEAN & CHEAP!]]></Title>
		<Negativereview>When you walk in the building looks beautiful, but it changes when you go to the room floors! The check-in line is CRAZY!!!! We just got into line the moment the line went around the hotel. The deposit they hold on your card takes daaaaays to clear. The rooms are super old looking, everything is very old. Storing your bag before or after your stay is $5 which is crazy compared to other hotels that are between .50 cents to $1. It's far from Time Square.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The lady at the check-in was nice! The elevators are quick! The rooms are very old looking but you could tell the rooms were clean! Clean rooms are always important! It was super cheap compared to other hotels. I liked that right outside on both sides of the street are taxi areas, so all we had to do was go outside and hail a cab.</Positivereview>

		<Title>I won't stay there again, and you never should.</Title>
		<Negativereview>It took almost an hour to check-in. We clocked one person taking up to 15 minutes for one person. We were promised a newly refurbished room, and it was far from refurbished. There were dirt marks and stains on the wall. The sheets were ripped, the blanket had cigarette burns in it. We slept on top of the comforter. There was no refrigerator. The television was in a position that you couldn't see it from anywhere except from the room door. It was in a piece of furniture that was too large for the room. The night table drawers were broken. The alarm clock went off at midnight and was so old and dirty that the words were no longer visible so it took a while to figure how to turn it off. The electrical plugs looked like they could start a fire at any point. One of the two keys we got didn't work the entire time. When the second key stopped working, we had to wait for 25 minutes to get a new one. I wouldn't stay there again; it was overpriced for all that it was lacking.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location was very central, right across from Penn Station which was great for using the subway , amtrak, and getting to and from the airport. The cleaning staff was very friendly, saying hello and good morning.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Queue to check in was ridiculous and very slow service. If you arrive before check in or want to leave your bags after you check out there is a $5 per bag charge. That is fine but they need to put something in place so that you can pay the charge to leave your bags and still use the fast check out service without having to stand in the ridiculous long and very slow moving queue. Took an hour on check out to arrange to leave our bags. Hotel is very "tired" in need or refurbishment but if you can get a reasonable deal and only want somewhere to lay your head it is adequate.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Dirty h/motel in a good location.</Title>
		<Negativereview>I understand that this is a two star hotel, however for the price I paid I expected it to at least be clean. The bathroom had dried blood on the inside of the door, the water in the shower was either scolding hot or cold and was barely coming out of the shower head, the tile in the shower cabin has been painted at some point in the past and now was peeling off, there was a strong smell of chlorine in the whole room, one of the bedside lamps was not working, neither was the hair dryer and there was a big stain of god knows what on my bed cover. There's a pungent smell of old, moldy carpet all over the halls. The whole hotel is crying to be updated, even just a fresh coat of paint and removal of those terrible window treatments would much improve the state of this place.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Perfeclty fine for the price! A room and a clean bed in Mid-town Manhattan.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Check in is very slow. I always expect to spend least 1/2 hour on line. I do realize that this hotel is a room factory and there is also a multi-national and language issue going on. While some customers were at the counter for over 10 minutes, I was at the counter for under 2. I wish they could have an express line to handle bookings that were made on-line and have no issues or changes to the card or room request.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The price. I just needed a room in Manhattan. I see people complain about the Pensy: the service was poor, the room wasn't pretty, I didn't have a view... to them I say: Get real! This is one of the least expensive hotels in Mid-town! If you want 1000 thread count sheets and a swanky suite, expect to pay at least 2 or 3 times the price of the Pensy. It was perfeclty fine for the price.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Great location, horrible customer service.</Title>
		<Negativereview>We booked the room 11 months in advance, yet when we checked in the room wasn't available. Instead of having a room with two double beds, we had 1 king bed and a roll away, which was so bad I ended up sleeping on the floor. Despite numerous attempts, they would not move us to the room we booked, saying there isn't anything available. There was a constant line of people checking out, and at one point while I was at the front desk, another group was able to switch rooms right next to me.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We were in town for the NCAA Wrestling Championships at MSG, so the location was ideal.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The additional *Faciities charge" seems like extortion. Including it in the room rate would be more honest. The check-in line sometimes takes an hour to get from the back to the desk. Shouldn't there be more desk personnel at peak periods</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Dirty rooms. Cleaning staff does nothing. Our door in our first room had people's spit on it that had never been cleaned off. The beds in 2 of the rooms had other people's hair between the sheets. Our last room had someone else's urine on the toilet. When we arrived for check in the was a homeless women not wearing pants or underwear just sitting in the lobby begging for pants! Absolutely disgusting!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>This was the nastiest place I have ever stayed in my life!. We changed rooms 3 times and then demanded our money back for the last 2 days we were there. This place is the absolute worst hotel on the planet! Booking.com should remove this hotel from there list!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>We waited 3 hours to check in. There was no communication at times there was no one at the desk. They stated they were trying to get ahold of the manager...it seemed they were all hiding in the back no one wanted to address anything. Finally got to our room just before 1:00 am. The room was small mattress very uncomfortable the bathroom was extremly old and lots of dirt in the corners, tv had no volume and was a small dated box tv. Shower curtain was splattered with something? We were offered a late check out for our inconvenience 🙄</Negativereview>

		<Title>Do not believe what you see on actual hotel website.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Do not believe anything you see on the actual hotel website as it is entirely inaccurate. The actual hotel is very very old and tired, and dirty. Checked in is from1500 onwards but every day you see the queue literally reaching the main entrance and it was an 1hr 30 minutes before we reached the unfriendly staff. The room is old and horrible. The bathroom is so awful that I have been to better washing/showering facilities at city train stations. The towels are turning grey but at least they changed it daily. Sockets are all lose on the wall and the TV is so old. There are very few TV channels to choose from and I have found CNN was my best TV friend. Although they provide you with free WiFi, its taken away at midnight before you checked out the next morning. The actual hotel staff are rude, even when you say good morning to them, they ignore you but the cleaning team is very friendly. Although there is express checked out service (key drop off) if you want to leave your luggage, you need to queue up for another hour so they can give you a paper tag to fill in. So there was no express check out for us. There is no bathroom at lobby level and the only bathroom is located at LL. You will know where it is as you could smell it from miles. If I have control on overall rating I would have given it a 2 instead of what Booking.com has calculated, 3.8. Like I said at the beginning, if you are not looking for comfort and just a bed and a room to shower then this hotel is ok.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The line to check in was just about an hour and a half long. Rooms are out dated. Tub was dirty. Beds, and pillows weren't comfortable. They charged me a $50 deposit as well as the room it's self. Still waiting on the deposit. No complimentary breakfast, and had to pay $11 for wifi because I didn't book directly through them. I wanted to cancel my reservation because I found something better (figures, after I paid already I'd find something better) but there was no cancellation. The parking garage was a block away so it was just a little inconvenient since we didn't want to pay more for valet. We were originally going to stay in nyc for 1 night, but decided to stay another, and went to the Hampton Inn north Manhattan the next day and it was amazing. Complimentary breakfast,clean, up to date, free wifi, and no deposit! Plus the parking garage was right next door. Will never go back to the Pennsylvania</Negativereview>

		<Title>Across from Penn Staion, but the street would be better.</Title>
		<Negativereview>A 30 minute checkin wait - 2 people on the desk an an endless line of guests. Sour staff. Window in the room stuck open and it was 30 degrees outside. No one would come to fix it despite repeated calls. Carpet in shreds, Paint peeling off walls. Disgustingly filthy upholstery on furniture. An antique Zenith tv that would not even turn on. A bathroom that defies description. In short- everything. This is without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I didn't have time for breakfast, I needed to quickly return to work from the previous day. Sadly, the first room I arrived at was totally unmade. For the value and cleanliness of my second room I should have easily been charged $25 for the night but I needed the rest. I'm sure many of the other rooms are quite adequate, but mine was sad. Happily, after I fell asleep, I didn't notice any of my problems . They should send a mechanic to that room to get some AC in the AC.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Avoid it Like The Plague: Dishonest Establishment, Rude staff, Dirty towels, Awful Room.</Title>
		<Negativereview>It's peobably the worst hotels I have stayed at. The policies are dishonest, the staff rude and the rooms awful. The ghastly experience started with the check in. We arrived at 1, and they wanted $40 more for early check in. We decided to wait and leave the luggage with concierge. "Ok $20 charge for that." So we checked in. The room was TINY. It was half the size of the room that they show you in the picture in the website. We called the front desk aNd they said we should be grateful because they had upgraded us to a higher category. Yeah right! The towels looked 50 years old. Threadbare, yellowing and dirty. The room was at the back with no view but still one could hear the traffic. So much for soundproofing. And the heating had no control. It was either very hot or we had to turn it off. The TV didn't work properly. There's no coffee maker in the room. Thank god. If they had provided one it would have to have been placed on the bed since there was no room for it anywhere else. I don't even want to get started on the wooden faced arrogant front desk people and the New York rude manager. I thought I would give them some feedback so at check out time I told the front desk lady what a bad establishment it is. She was obviously thick skinned having heard this before. All she said was "come again." Not in your lifetime lady! Of course they don't care. They get enough business from unwary tourists who descend in droves. As for me I will avoid the hotel like the plague.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Pretty much nothing except the location, the shower and the bed. Do yourself a favor. Pay a little more and stay elsewhere.</Positivereview>

		<Title>One night stay from hell!!!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Toilet leaked when flushed, sink pipes leaked when you ran water. No counter space around sink. Old bed mattresses and bedding. If you hung cloths in little closet you couldn't shut door. No safe. Lighting in room was very dim and only had a small window. The heating had no adjustment so our eyes were burning the whole time. Had to check out next morning could not stay.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Will never stay here again</Title>
		<Negativereview>Everything else. I've stayed in two star hotels all over the world and I have always found the staff to be caring, but not here. They only do the minimum when it comes to everything. The operator's job seems to be to run interference for the other departments. For example, say you have to call to open the window because it's only designed for a 6' guy. An hour and a half and three phone calls later, someone will finally come. Meantime, you've almost wound up in the ER from your roommate's perfume and the lack of ventilation in the bathroom. Nothing is ever urgent. The room itself is ordinary, but you'll miss the little things. I would like/expect a guide to the TV channels, a window I can open and close myself, a sink stopper that actually works, a guide to local attractions, and even what's available right in the hotel, a guide to the hotel's services (including hours for housekeeping, a full price list for the laundry, etc.), a fridge that's actually big enough for more than one meal. These have been in all my other hotel rooms. Don't have an issue with the business center 'cause the hotel will tell you they have nothing to do with it and pure robbery anyway. Don't ask for the bellman's help in closing an overstuffed suitcase. Don't ask the concierge about what's close by 'cause you'll barely get a usable answer. No one will tell you, for instance, that a bunch of restaurants deliver right to the hotel. Don't try to get one of the cabs in front of the hotel, 'cause they're probably giving kickbacks to the doorman to sit there and illegally refuse to take anyone anywhere but the airport. Have your Uber, etc. meet you and the doorman will try to get the vehicle ticketed even though it's there for you, a hotel guest. There is a serious lack of basic courtesy and I will never stay there again. I don't need fancy, but I do expect better.</Negativereview>

Found food, hair, balls of dust, windows opaque with grime, fingernail clippings on the sill, slime in the tub, NO hot water, collapsed mattresses, hair drier wire burned through, electric outlets inoperable, evidence of previous electrical fire, NO prior notice of 100$ deposit for room beyond hotel stay!

		<Title>Rude housekeeper</Title>
		<Negativereview>The housekeeper on our floor was very rude. She took off the "Do not disturb"-sign and went into our room (while we were there). I asked her where the sign was, and she acted as if she hadn't just seen it and taken it off. She even forced her way into the room even though we clearly told her "NO SERVICE NEEDED". She went into the bathroom and took out the trash, although we said: NO. I guess she REALLY wanted to be able to add one more room that has been "cleaned" on her list. The last time I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania, the housekeeper (a different one) was at least honest up front and asked us if it was OK for us that she wrote in her paperwork that she had cleaned our room all the days we were there (she saw our "Do not disturb"-sign on the door when we ran into her in the hallway, and we didn't want or need any service during our stay). "Sure, no problem", we said. If they want to add our room to their list, sure, go ahead, but please respect our "Do not disturb"-sign. We have dogs in the room, for God's sake! If the housekeeper that took off the sign on the door and went into our room had been there while we were out of the room, the dog might have gotten out, and if that had happened and something happened to our dog, the housekeeper and the hotel would be facing a law suit, for sure.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Great location and very pet friendly! We went to the Westminster show, and the entire lower lobby was doggy heaven!</Positivereview>

Had to go to front desk to speak to a manager. Then next day tried taking a shower and water came out brown. Room looked dirty and smelled dusty.

		<Title>My somewhat disappointing surprise birthday stay for my husband.</Title>
		<Negativereview><![CDATA[1st room was freezing even with heat at highest setting. Water constantly dripping in bathroom tub/shower fixture. 2nd room extremely warm & had to shut heat off/low as it could go. Walls stained and needed to be painted. Again, more water dripping in tub/shower. Also, first room had wrinkles in carpeting that was very old. If plumbing got repaired to stop all water waste, the $$ saved or a good portion of the $$ could be used to pay for the needed improvements. If the CEO, booked a regular room at this hotel I would be willing to bet he would find the room conditions UNACCEPTABLE and I personally love to hear his thoughts. Personally, I think this hotel is an icon and think with the proper improvements, it could become known s the hotel you would just have to stay at. I sincerely hope the people at the top go and see this hotel personally and see the potential that is clearly there. Also, the shower was like being pelted with hail-stones.]]></Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Very disappointed in only milk served for coffee in restaurant. Excuse given made no sense several days in a row. Simply not bought for use in coffee was the apparent reality, in my opinion. Asked for bread service for breakfast and told none available until lunch service. However, I could order a sandwich.. which I assume included the bread. :) Parking fee too high as compared to other years. May I also add , my not like items are not big ones. Overall, my experience was pleasant and I look forward to next year. Thank you!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Liked the size of our room as compared to what others had. There were no bed bugs :) Excellent in that area. Our room was clean, just old. Convenience of dog potty area was awesome. Liked the restaurant. Good food.- Best hamburgers !!!!! Even with my not like items, I had a wonderful experience overall and look forward to next year. I want that same room !! :) Thank you !!!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview><![CDATA[Window did not open without the help of maintenance. We didn't know that the heat was controlled by a switch on the wall so with a window open and the wind blowing overnight without heat, the room was about 40 degrees in the morning. To be comfortable, you have to turn the heat on & off. Shower was a trickle that was either hot or cold...no in between. Furnishings were dated but room felt clean. Bed was ok. Carpet felt dirty. Had a problem with one of the lamps in the room; Requested towels when none were left during the day and they never showed up. Was ok; this hotel has 2 stars for a reason. Lots of elevators so never waited more than a minute for an elevator.]]></Negativereview>

Called the next day after we left early and was told that there was no note on file about our complaint so we get no refund for staying in a roach infested hotel.

		<Negativereview>Check in was a little trying because the lines extending from the stairs up to the front desk. The lines to check in and to check out (if you didn't do express check out) was overwhelming. It moves pretty fairly but was ridiculous to walk up too especially when you just want to check in or just check out.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Hotel Penn is in a centralized location and I love that. I was able to walk around on my own or had an abundance of cabs and ubers to choose from. I was informed that this hotel was one of the oldest hotels in NYC. It still has it old flare and layout which is dated but it's fine. The ambiance does not effect your stay unless you need a modern day hotel. It was a great space and an easy flow from the lobby to the rooms.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Bare Essentials</Title>
		<Negativereview>The hotel only has the bare essentials if you are booking a standard room. The beds are nothing special and you will probably have to request extra pillows. The toiletries in the bathroom are not great and our hairdryer did not even work. A piece of the desk was peeling off. The bathroom was a little dirty in the crevices and did not seem like it was cleaned with detail in mind. The faucet on the sink was wiggly and the shower head leaked. There wasn't even a box of tissues in the room. There were a lot of marks on the walls. The sheets and bed linens were outdated and even had small holes and rips in them.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is in prime location but keep in mind that there will be a lot of noise from the street. If you are looking to stay in Times Square but do not have the money, this is just as good. The location is what you are paying for- not luxury. There was a fridge and the rooms were big for being in the middle of the city. The bathroom was updated.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>This hotel caters to teenage tour groups. With paper thin walls, that means that you hear kids playing music and talking well into 1am or so. The front desk line is an absolute nightmare. There is no concierge, so just to ask a simple question, you have to wait about 30 mins most of the day, along with people just checking in. The lobby looks like a busy airport terminal full of people with canceled flights most of the time.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Hotel was aweful...staff mean and rude...rooms were not just old but falling apart.flushed toilet and water leaked from handle everywhere. Shower had no pressure so it was a trickle of water. Walls were cracked and falling apart. Ceiling tiles were dirty. We check out early and staff would not let us talking to Manger at all about our room...was supposed to be a romantic Valentine's weekend with my wife was ruined. We will never again stay in the city....</Negativereview>

		<Title>Don't waste your money</Title>
		<Negativereview>Almost everything in the room, after a long wait for check in which was understandable due to an event in the area we arrived in our room to find it almost gross feeling. Chipped or peeling paint on about 90% of the walls. Water damage spot in a corner. A tv that if we could actually get the static to stop had none of the channels advertised as available to us. We also noticed blood on the comforter that they did change for us but gave real no apologies for the blood being there. We also requested more pillows seeing how they only gave us two for a king that we waited over an hour for them to be delivered before giving up because they never sent the extra pillows up. The bed itself was lumpy and hard as a rock, not something I was expecting from a "superior king room". The showers water smelled of pure iron and the rest of the bathroom looked like it came out of an elementary school. In all honestly I wouldn't feel ok spending 25 dollars in this place let alone the amount I had to actually pay.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel was closed to big hot spots for a New York night experience.</Positivereview>

		<Title>If not for the location, would not suggest to anyone. Price was cheap though.</Title>
		<Negativereview>Reached hotel at 9.30 PM and was on the footpath out in the cold with my bags with no bellboy in sight. Had to drag mh bags in myself one by one with risk of leaving bags unattended outside. Check-in staff and manager were quite rude and calous attitude. Although first person on counter who checked me in was very helpful and friendly, but after that it was all downhill. Had to stand in the queue for 30 minutes just to get a baggage tkt. After a 9 day stay, manager would not even oblige with a late check out. Would not even listen to the rqst. Rooms were very dusty and small. Shower was a small 4x4 booth like what we see in prisons in movies. Very horrible with hardly any space to stand even. I am surprised hotels in a city like NY can hv such showers nowadays, worse than a dormitory. Had to wait 25 minutes in the luggage room for a bell boy to take bags to taxi. And then the doorman and bellboy want tips separately, forcefully, forcefully underlined.</Negativereview>

They just swiped the card & showed me the rate for the room without tax & cleaning (87$) when i checked my bankstatements 221$ had been charged (price of the room & charges +100$ guarantee which nobody mentioned) the refund of the 100$ will take over a week !!!? Normally in case of garantee, the amount is never debited first. The penn 5000 club advantages were not given to me although i booked this & asked for it. Windows in the room can be opened but the spring is so won out, you have to call maintenance to open or close the window Wifi, early check in, luggage locker room very expensive. The deal is a con !!!! Apart from Raymond, all the other staff at front office were rude & unfriendly. Although i v used booking.com for many years, this hotel is not to recommend at all !!!!]]></Negativereview>

		<Title>Good stay - after we changed a room</Title>
		<Negativereview>It was too noisy, we stayed at the 8th floor and we could hardly sleep at night due to the street noise. We also had a leak in our bathroom which with the broken door not able to close was a total inconvenience. When I asked to be moved to another room with no leak issues, it took a couple of days to take us seriously. I asked for a refund for these 2 nights that I had to stay in that room although I already reported this problem and the staff supervisor told me that as this is a non refundable booking, I could not get a refund. Obviously she thought we were ignorant of the fact that cancelling a booking and asking for a compensation were 2 different things</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location was amazing for first time visitors in New York however I would choose something more quite for my next visit as this hotel is just in the middle of the busy city centre, opposite Madison square. The shared areas of the hotel are nice and the building has a historical value to the area.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Travelers Beware of The Hotel Pennsylvania!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Hotel is dirty, had a rat run across my hotel room floor. I complained and was moved to another room on the 15th floor. This room had traps set behind the register. Obviously, the hotel had an issue with rodents. I couldn't sleep, worried I would have another unwanted roommate. I checked out in the am, canceling my additonal nights stay.Management in the morning, was very rude, refused to refund my money. Told me it was New York, all hotels have mice and rats. I am an area nurse manager for the Federal Government. I have been staying in New York hotels since Nov and this was the first time I had a rodent in my room. Because of my connections, we will see what the department of health has to say about the Hotel Pennsylvania. Avoid staying at this hotel for any reason!!</Negativereview>

		<Title>If you want more than "location" than don't stay here.</Title>
		<Negativereview>It took 30 minutes to check in and then when we got to our room, it hadn't been cleaned, so we waited again. There was no shower pressure and half the water still came out of the faucet instead of the shower head. The room was dingy. The pillows were like flat cardboard. The room was very hot and the cool didn't work on the system in the room. There was no view but the other side of the hotel and the curtains were dirty.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is good and the lobby is very nice.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Dirty Dirty Rooms; Pleasant Staff; Nice Location; DO NOT STAY HERE</Title>
		<Negativereview>We waited in line for an hour to check in. When we went to the room, it was extremely dirty. The walls in several places had lines of dried liquid marks that had run down the walls. There were black scuff marks in several places on the walls. The carpet was dirty and the edges at the walls were dust filled. They moved us to another room, which was also dirty, but not as dirty. No lines of substances running down the walls, but still scuff marks on the walls, dirty floors, and soot crusted windows. We took all the bedding off the bed, and replaced the sheets, pillowcases, and bath towels. We didn't use the blanket. The others that we traveled with, 20+ people also had filthy rooms. In 40 years, this is the dirtiest place I have ever stayed at, which includes USA, Europe, and Asia.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Room was poor and in need of a referb. This is my third visit to Manhatten and I've never queued for a check in like I did here, stayed in such a drab room or slept on such an uncomfortable bed. Honestly felt like I was sleeping on concrete. The price is what attracted me ... That location for so cheap.. I'm hardly a snob so thought what could go wrong? Answer. A lot. I would encourage people to pay a little more and get much better quality or maybe stay in a cheaper area. Check is staff were wonderful but the others were rude.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Small rooms for 4 people, kids on fl 16 parents on fl 6, told on arrival we would be moved the next day and after 6 days no room change made. Breakfast was average for the cost and I used Macys WiFi as I couldn't use The Pennsylvania WiFi at all. The marijuana stench each morning and afternoon as we left our room and returned was gross, more than one room too you could smell it straight off the lifts all the way to our room which was a few corridors away.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>1. My Debit card was swiped even after telling an agent that it will block an amount instead of pre authorization. I clearly said that I will pay cash and gave full cash advance for my accommodation and incidentals. 2. No smile 4. No luggage assistance asked 5. Agent told me that check In time is 2pm. I arrived at 1355,and I was asked to wait, or else they will charge me 40$ for early check in (Really !!!! For 5 min !!!!) 6. Room was horrible. Bathroom tiles are chipped. No hot water. No telephone lines in the room (security hazard- what if I need immediate medical assistance,and I had go miles away at Front desk to ask for an assistance. Not acceptable) I did not make a fuss about it, because I was there for one night. But these things are horrible and unacceptable for a city centre hotel where guests come for a basic service and expects helful staff</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Let me say this: The staff doesn't speak proper english, is rude to its customers and lies about the rooms. After several room changes, I decided to leave this Hotel and go elsewhere. The rooms in this Hotel are all dirty, smelly and not even good for a third world country. Believe me, I have seen 5 rooms of this hotel and all were dirty with apparently broken windows. The lounge is just a facade, don't get fooled. The first impression when you enter this hotel is just a big lie. I would never ever go to this hotel again. I would prefer sleeping on the New York Streets. Go elsewhere. There are plenty hotels nearby with much better quality for the same price as this garbage Hotel or lower. I can't believe this property is even called a Hotel. Cheers travelers!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The lines at check in are ridiculous it takes pretty much an hour or more to get to the desk and get checked in..... This happens every time!! The showers and water in the rooms are awful at times we had scolding hot water out of the taps and even when the toilet was flushed but the next minute only freezing cold water! The TVs were of poor quality and many marks and stains to floors walls ceilings etc! Fine place to go as a group of lads going to do shopping and the bars but wouldn't take the wife here as she would not be happy!!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We have been here before as the location is excellent and for the price and being a group of mates all we really need is beds.... You don't go to New York to sit in the room! The staff are generally pretty good and the cleaners go in every day! Good little coffee shop and store in the lobby!</Positivereview>

		<Title>Definitely not luxurious, but good enough for the location</Title>
		<Negativereview>This hotel is very old and in need of many repairs. There were a lot of cracks/holes in the walls (around pipes or outlets), which could be easily fixed to prevent bugs and other critters from entering our living areas. The bathroom was small and it was hard to get ready because there was not a lot of space to put my belongings on. The grossest part of this stay was definitely the carpet in our room and in the hallways. There was literally duct tape on the rips in the carpet in the hallway. It kind of made me feel like the maintenance on this hotel is just lazy because they could have taped up some of the holes in the walls while they were at it. I would definitely bring a pair of flip flops or slippers if I were going to stay in this hotel again. I would also make sure I was staying on the 13th floor or higher, as many of the bug complaints seemed to be coming from lower level rooms. The most annoying part of this experience was the hidden fees. The hotel actually charged me about $30 a night for wifi and gym access (which we never used and had no plans of using) and a $100 deposit which has not been refunded to me as of yet. In my experience a deposit is typically returned unless there are damages to the room.... which was already quite damaged when we got there.... so why my deposit has not been refunded is curious to me.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location of this hotel was excellent for our stay. We went to a four day show at Madison Square Garden and the location of this hotel made our time in New York so much better. We didn't even need to wear our coats to the show! Our bed and bathroom were clean enough and we did not see any bugs during our stay, not even a spider. We did not wake up with any weird bites or rashes which was great considering what I saw and read in other reviews. Our water pressure and temperature were also good. We had no problems with our plumbing or toilet. We had an awesome view of the Empire State Building and the hotel is very close to a lot of restaurants and coffee spots. The staff at the hotel (specifically housekeeping) were very polite and attentive to our needs. We got fresh towels and sheets whenever we requested them. I also spoke to a manager named Carmen prior to our stay (regarding bed bug complaints I read about in other reviews). She was very realistic and helpful when I spoke to her. She did not try to lie to me about the issue but gave me some good advice about how to handle any situation that might come up and assured me that the staff would take care of any issues that might arise. Luckily we didn't have any issues. This hotel is definitely not glamorous but it was good enough to meet my needs. I definitely wouldn't book the cheapest room in this hotel.... you get what you pay for.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>This time, there was a rat in my room and the (un-adjustable) heat was on so high, I started feeling sick. (It was unseasonably warm in NY, and the hotel-wide heating system was turned on despite that.) I asked to cancel the remainder of my stay, and they said they couldn't reimburse me any of it. So I was offered another room, this one also very hot. Finally, the third room was a bearable temperature (still quite warm). Look, I'm not picky or I wouldn't be staying here to begin with, but this was my last stay there. I'll gladly sacrifice location for a room that doesn't make me feel ill and a hotel where they at least act surprised to hear about a rat running around. This place is enough of a compromise to begin with...</Negativereview>

		<Title>Good value for money</Title>
		<Negativereview>The check in took a very long time. We were told we were waiting for a room to be assigned to us and it took a fair amount of time. The lady who checked us in just disappeared leaving us to stand there until the roon was ready with little explication. Apart from check in staff were helpful, room seemed dingy and grotty at first but beds were comfy, TV was good and no problems with the shower facilities. Very good location. We would return. I would give the hotEl 3/4 stars out of 5.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I didn't like the fact the courtyard rooms were actually across the other side of a busy road from the hotel. The hotel needs to employ a traffic warden to cross you over.

		<Title>Very overpriced, much nicer places to stay in this area</Title>
		<Negativereview>Firstly the room was tiny, there was no A/C and a towel rail that was permanently on meaning the room was baking hot, as it is next to a busy road opening the windows made it too noisy. The shower barely worked and the aroma from the bathroom wasnt pleasant! At the price you pay per night my expectations was much higher in every which way! Breakfast was very limited and not that enjoyable! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone mainly because of the price you pay I would expect the facilities to be much better! I never usually write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I needed to!</Negativereview>

		<Title>An enjoyable and pleasant stay with the proviso about pricing.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The price. In common with most places in the UK, accommodation is extremely expensive compared to Europe. As Bakewell is an attractive place and a haven for tourists this helps to inflate prices. What Bakewell needs is a Premier Inn and/or Travel Lodge whose accommodation is reasonably priced and this would help to reduce prices in the area generally.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is central and therefore convenient. Parking outside our room was also a bonus.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Good food and location but would not go back</Title>
		<Negativereview>After requesting a twin-bedded room and ringing up on the day to confirm it, we were given a double. We were then moved to terrible room in main building - cramped and facing onto service yard and air conditioning unit. The bedside cabinet was so close to the wardrobe that one door could not be opened. En suite contained basic facilities and a small shelf - nothing else. No room to put anything, white-tiled and would not have been out of place in a hospital. Half a dozen flies in the room on the second night - now splattered on the window and wall! We were a group of 3 but all the breakfast tables were for 2 so each morning we had to wait while they eventually pushed 2 tables together. The service in general was grudging and unfriendly.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location in the centre of Bakewell is good, and the food was excellent. There was a good choice for dinner in the restaurant and everything was beautifully cooked and presented. The breakfast had a range of hot food cooked to order as well as fruit, cereals, continental and pastries.</Positivereview>

		<Title>A lovely old tradional hotel in a charming old town.</Title>
		<Negativereview>I am somewhat reluctant to criticize the restuarant staff for fear of expecting too much,but being the only table not to be offered bread,and then not recieving any when requested seemed a little odd.I then waited 20 minutes to have the main course plate taken away before I could order my pudding. I had the ribeye steak which was thin and tasteless.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>I had a good experience overall, when reviewing hotels it is only fair to judge value for money as there are allways better places to stay if you have a deep pocket .that said ,I found the Rutland very good.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The only tiny disappointment was the shower - it looked like new, very clean and spacious but there was such a low water pressure, I felt I didn't dare wash my (long) hair for fear of not being able to rinse off the shampoo! Not sure if this is just a problem with it being a 19th Century building?</Negativereview>

The room was at ground level with a window overlooking the hotel car park,not a pleas ant view,even if you could see through the dark nets.FInally the coffee at breakfast was awful-not sure what they had done to it.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Christmas presant for my parents!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Was a presant for my parents. They seemed to really enjoy it. A lot of praise from them about the hotel. Mum liked the wide selection for breakfast. Good location as they enjoy walking through the countryside. The owner was very helpful with replying to my emails about payment and everything with it being a presant. Would recommend Medow lodge :)</Negativereview>

		<Title>Good breakfast!</Title>
		<Negativereview>We locked ourselves on the balcony with 2 small children (4 and 7 years) at 10 pm, because the door closed itself behind our backs and we couldn't open it anymore. After an hour, we managed to get the attention from a man cleaning the garden. When an attendant came, no excuses, nothing, just that an engineer would come next day. Next day we went to reception, manager was not available, but we were given access to some lounge. On last day we asked for a late check out at 18 hours. They could offer for free till 15 hours. We can understand that if the hotel was full, but there were hardly any people in the hotel. Disappointing. Next time we will go back to the Interconti where the service level is much better.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Good breakfast! For small children they have a nice kids club!</Positivereview>

		<Title>Disappointing, dated and unimpressed</Title>
		<Negativereview>sadly disappointed from start until end. The initial entrance and facade is large so impresses in size and fountains but found that it stopped there. Facilities seem basic and dated both in room and beyond. no ambiance, dirty carpets, beds not overly comfortable, waiters clearing plates before we had finished eating from them and staff showed no regard for my 80 yo mother in assisting at such an expansive place. For the price tag, we were all under impressed at our stay. There are considerably better places for which over 2000aed per night can be better spent. Sent a note stating similar to best give feedback to the duty manager and heard nothing to date. Disappointing to say the least.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Lovely place to stay in!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Not so organized when it comes to permit. It's so annoying that their Public Relation Department do not know how to disseminate information with their staff (security). We keep insisting that we have permit and they can call their PR Department, and then afterwards we we will just knew that it was'nt relay to other staff. We do understand that security is very tight, but nevertheless we secured our permit prior to our pre-nup shoot (for hassle - free but I guess I'm surprise). This is not so good, showing that the management is weak when it comes to this. We were guest (knowing that we wait for 2 hours before we got our room) at the same time and we value our money as staying in this hotel is very expensive.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>We can understand that tourists in Abu Dhabi would also like to see this impressive hotel. But sometimes the loads of tourist strolling through the hotel was a bit disturbing. Especially, as some of them don't now how to behave in such a surrounding. For instance we saw people laying on the floor and posing for pictures. This is spoiling the standard of this hotel.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Really bad food and service in the restaurant.</Title>
		<Negativereview><![CDATA[The food is appalling and the service is really not at a 5 star standard. Really disappointed with the dinner in the international buffet restaurant. My wife couldn't find a single main course that was appetising, all the mains had a huge layer of oil on the top, there was only one vegetable and that was brussel sprouts! The live station of risotto was an absolute disaster, basically boiled rice with a little asparagus in it, bland overcooked and simply not risotto. The service was terrible, we had to ask to get our table cleared and the manager simply didn't know how to deal with our complaint. To be told that the food is not normally so bad, the chef who cooked the risotto cannot cook but his senior is on a five minutes break and that there is a new exec chef who will sort it all out in the future, simply is not good enough. I felt like I was at fault for going there on that night!! As we were eating our dessert they kept offering us more main course to make up for the poor quality of the original mains and then they put a hot coffee down in front of my wife (who doesn't drink coffee) and my 8 month old daughter who was on my wifes knee, my daughter promptly reached over and had hot coffee all over her! Really not a 5 star hotel food and beverage venue. I give credit to the senior management who did come and find us in the morning and were profuse in their apologies and very sincere in the way they handled the issues. I hope they fix the F & B though as it really lets the hotel down.]]></Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The extra touches in our room prior to arrival such as the rubber ducks in the bath for our daughter and the butler with fresh juice on arrival. The drive into the hotel grounds is beautiful and the hotel is so grand that it really captures the imagination. Lovely reception staff. The pool for kids was great and I think the idea of the free bikes was a very good one.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Worst experience ever! I travelled with my parents during Chinese New Year, having spent over £500 for a night, I would've expected to enjoy the service, instead it was all nightmare! For starter, the guy named Martin who checked us in and out at the reception was arrogant and impolite, didn't use any courtesy language, no Please or Could you throughout ! It was all give me this, sign here, bossing around! After checked in, we called from the room to make a reservation for 3 at the buffer dinner restaurant at the hotel, but when we arrived at the restaurant, it only showed booking for 2! when we finally got the seat and ordered drinks and ice, the waiter only brought 2 drinks and forgot about the third drink and ice! We waited for over 20 mins and have to chase him for that, the waiter didn't even say sorry and didn't take any of our plates until we ask him to! Above all, only 30 mins after we sat down, the waiter brought us the bill! Said to me and I quote' Am I making myself clear? I want to settle the bill first!' I complained to his manager, and the manager brought us coffee as a gesture. Sadly this is not the end of the story! Next morning when I was checking out, the girl at the reception kept saying that we used 3 breakfasts after I told her explicitly we only used one, she brought that Martin guy who is her supervisor to double check, took 5 mins and when I finally cleared my name, Martin didn't make any apology as if it was me who caused this nonsense until I started making a formal complaint. And even then, he didn't show me any respect, that boss attitude again! didn't look at me while speaking to me, took my email address wrong 4 times! It was a total disaster staying at this hotel and it completely ruined my holiday!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The rooms are not in the level of a 5 star hotel. The worst room we stay for this classification. The lights are very complicated to turn on and off, due a very bad automation system. Check-in and check out took ages.</Negativereview>

		<Title>A unique and wonderful palatial experience</Title>
		<Negativereview>Everything in this hotel was excellent, including the food. As expected, it cost a lot to eat here in the restaurants. Make sure you plan for some expensive meals when you stay here.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We liked everything! It really is a most amazing place to stay. From the grand entrance, the staff welcome, the gold encrusted everything, the views of the Abu Dhabi and the ocean, the two huge swimming complexes, the gym, the many restaurants, the ballroom, the hectares of manicured grounds - every sight your eyes land upon is a delight. It is an exceptional building designed in a way to be simply beautiful at every turn. There are moments of delight wherever you go. This place is an indulgence for the average family, but we wanted a special holiday for ourselves and three children and even though we were nervous about how much it would cost to stay there, Emirates Palace really delivers. We had a butler! I can't even begin to list all the things to see and do at this hotel. We stayed 2 nights and could not physically fit in all the activities available for guests. The grounds are beautiful and free bicycles are available to ride around the adjoining Marina and the Palace property. Where else can you ride a camel on the beach, play snooker beside the Arabian Sea then have a cappuccino sprinkled with 24 carat gold? The staff were extremely friendly and professional - We loved our stay here.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Very disappointing, consistently poor service, would not stay here again.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The customer service was consistently very poor, from greeting on arrival, how long it took to order lunch at the beach, drinks orders arriving wrong, and no effort made by any staff to know our names. Hoards of tourists arrive everyday to take photos of the lobby plus the property is so huge it took over 10 minutes to walk from the room to the front entrance.Over £20 for a beer on the beach is excessive, especially when it takes over 30 minutes to arrive.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The beach was absolutely fantastic, spacious and relaxing.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>As it was our 51st wedding anniversary we booked an "executive room" we ended up with a "family" room, set up for three! Although where the third would sit was a mistery, as there were only one comfy chair and a dining type chair, "executive"? Room. What an expensive mistake.</Negativereview>

		<Title>A very friendly and hospitable hotel with an excellent location; pity about the en suite.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The en suite bathroom is very tired and is somewhat hazardous in that the facilties are accessed from two steps which are unequal in width and depth.Any wet on the bathroom floor would render these steps dangerous. We had room 28;the 4poster, and in our view this room is unsuitable for elderly people and this should be made clear.Also the shower does not function when removed from the vertical position.The view from this room is not good and overall we do not believe that this room represents good value for money.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We liked the friendlness and professionalism of the staff and the excellent location.We were also impressed with the standard of food in the restaurant.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Enjoyable and welcoming.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The windows were a bit off putting, the building is old but there was some mould on the windows of all 3 rooms we booked. I don't suppose it is totally avoidable but it was a bit like an obstacle course using corridors because of all the cleaning stuff trolleys and bedding/towel bags left in them at all hours of the day. We had to actually move some to get past at one point. Despite the fact we returned to the hotel at a reasonably early hour only the wine bar was open, the other bar was closed and shuttered.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The atmosphere was good, the hotel has lots of character. It provides very interesting information about the history of the hotel which was fascinating. Location excellent. Staff very helpful and friendly and joined in with a birthday we had. The rooms were warm and for the most part welcoming. They were lovely and clean with comfortable facilities, only grumble were the windows (see 'what didn't you like). The breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Despite one or two minor items we would definitely stop again because of the plus points.</Positivereview>

		<Title>A 2 night stay for short break</Title>
		<Negativereview>A very apparent thick cobweb was in the bathroom with visible dust along the higher sills and as such, let down the standard of the rest of the room itself. The food I found ok, nothing special and rather overpriced The breakfast was again ok but I wouldn't say award winning as claimed. Service was until 10am,but from 9am onwards it appeared that neither the fruit or pastries were not replenished and as such, choice was very limited especially on our second day. On the first morning service was excellent, we had a large table reserved and I was impressed. What a difference a day makes, the second morning, the 6 of our party were squashed in a cornered seating area, staff service almost non existent, part of the breakfast request came late and at no time were we asked if we would like more tea or coffee or if everything was ok. Just a touch of courtesy really. I would also suggest that you remove the out of date information cards regarding Buxton market. After searching for the supposed twice weekly event, we were told by a local person that there hadn't been a market in the area for a long time!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We had a standard room which had a comfortable bed and pillows even though the flooring was uneven and sloping. This however just gave a quirky character to the room we occupied. The bathroom provided all toiletries you would need for a stay here The tea and coffee facilities in the room were very good and replenished daily. The bedroom itself was clean and tidy</Positivereview>

		<Title>Wonderful hotel right opposite Buxtons fabulous park.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The weather but that's hardly the hotels fault.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>We love the olde worldly charm of the hotel, the creaky, sloping floors and comfortable rooms and the fact it's so dog friendly. Immaculately clean and the breakfast was excellent.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Good base in the Peak District</Title>
		<Negativereview>Could do with a bit of a revamp. Decor is a bit tired but to be expected I suppose given the age of the building. Floors very uneven. Adds to the charm to a certain extent.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Extremely disappointed</Title>
		<Negativereview>Dirty, smelly hotel. Very down market. You can smell the fusty smell as soon as you step through the very small revolving door...... Try getting a case into a revolving door. Take a look at the carpet... you cannot avoid it... It is filthy. Half past three in the afternoon we were resting on the bed after a long journey... One of the staff - without knocking - unlocked the door and walked in with a bottle of water. We complained at reception about this invasion of privacy.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Breakfast was the only saving grace for this tired and dirty hotel</Positivereview>

		<Title>The coldest hotel I have ever stayed in</Title>
		<Negativereview>The hotel is freezing cold - so cold we couldn't sit in the restaurant or bar comfortably. The evening meal was a complete disappointment - the most basic meal and poorly presented - not what I had expected for such a lovely hotel and especially for my husband's 50th birthday meal The meal was described as having mashed potato but came out without it - when we queried it the staff didn't seem to know how the meal was supposed to be served! Despite this we were still charged for extra vegetables despite our first choice of meal not being available, and having been served a meal without the mash in the first place</Negativereview>

		<Title>Lovely hotel pity about the smell</Title>
		<Negativereview>We stayed upstairs and the only bad thing I found which needs reporting is the smell on the stairs! It's a cross between old musty and if the carpets been wet/waged but not dried properly. It was especially bad in the morning after the doors both being shut all night the smell hits the back of your throat as soon as you open the doors. It is quite choking and made me gag. Definately needs a professional clean and drying properly to rid the smell</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Beautiful property but a bit higgeldy piggeldey a bit like the house that Jack built with the uneven floors that creaked, un level stairs and hand rails and unusual set out of rooms. The breakfast room is as soon as you walk in with the reception half way down a long corridor. The car park available is directly outside but do not buy a ticket on the street... The reception can print you a 24hour ticket for £3 which can be added to your room bill. Staff very helpful. Breakfast is plentiful with a huge array of selection to suit everyone's needs. Very helpful staff in the breakfast room. Room is of good size with a teddy on the bed! And a good selection of complimentary toiletries, water and tea and coffee. Good also to see a hairdryer in the room</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The hotel seems a little dated when you first arrive but the room was lovely with good quality furnishings and plenty of room. Everything from the bedding to the towels was high on quality and showed that the management are really trying to give customers the best possible experience. It's in a great location on the edge of town, surrounded by parkland and within 5 minutes walk of the town centre. The Opra House is just across the road and I had an enjoyable evening watching Dial M for Murder! All in all an excellent stay and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. Breakfast was great also!.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Didn't live up to expectations.</Title>
		<Negativereview>We paid more for a supposedly better room. We felt we would like to have more quality than the standard room advertised so we upgraded to a superior room. The room was at the very rear of the hotel and the size and décor of the room were of a very basic standard with some wall coverings coming away or bubbling. This trip was a pre Christmas treat for my partner and I and the room let it down considerably. We love Buxton and normally stay at the Grand but decided this year to try something new. I'm not sure if we would use this hotel again.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were very pleasant and breakfast was of a high standard. All staff from desk, cleaning and restaurant were pleasant and very helpful.</Positivereview>

They're not approachable and accomadating. They don't smile to the guest. The queue to the reception is so long. Seems like they had a hard time processing each booking of the guest. Also I saw 1 of the guest complaining to 1 of the staff because he took almost 1 hour before they completely processed his transaction. The furniture of the room is old and the floor carpet look so old and dirty. You need more friendly staff.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Good value and great location</Title>
		<Negativereview>We came twice within a few weeks, and both times the wait for check-in at the reception area was exceedingly long. It is not very comfortable waiting 30+ minutes in a line where you must stand. They definitely need more staff at the reception desk.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is excellent. Very close to the BTS Nana station, and to many, many restaurants and shopping. There is also a small grocery store very close. The pool is clean and refreshing. It's nice to lay floating and watch birds and planes fly overhead. It's also nice to swim at sunset and watch the colours in the sky from the pool. The pool is mostly deep, so there isn't much shallow area for the not-so-strong swimmers. Our room was in the older part of the hotel, and wasn't very large, but there was plenty of room for 2 of us and our luggage. The bed was comfortable, the tv and ac worked fine. Very good value for the price with such a good location and the pool. The wifi was a bit dodgy, but we called, and they came very soon to fix it up for us. The staff were helpful, and requested taxis, etc., were all on time.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>Quick check in despite being attended to by a trainee. Friendly staff throughout the hotel. Clean room with no insects or other wildlife. Efficient check out and very helpful concierge. The car/travel desk by the front entrance was unmanned; it seems the company operating that service has gone (but everyone was too polite to tell me why) - however, the concierge quickly secured a taxi to the airport and I was amazed at the price - Bht 270 + Bht 75 tolls versus Bht 1,400 from the now defunct travel desk and Bht 1,200 for an AOT Camry from the airport to the hotel. I miss the friendly travel desk staff but I always knew their prices were overinflated. My room in the tower on one of the lower floors was west facing and hence very quiet. Excellent wifi.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Very Poor Hospitality. One of the WORST hotels in Sukhumvit Area.</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room quality was below average. I paid THB 1700 per night and did not get much in return. I have stayed in other hotels in Sukhumvit with the same price range before and I have had far more premium experience at the same price range. The room was kind of smelly. Later, I found out that the smell was coming from the toilet. So, the toilet was in fact dirty. The shower in the toilet was broken; it was giving boiling hot water and no cold water. The hotel plumber came to check but was unable to fix it. There was no hair dryer in the room which is a basic item in all hotels. Housekeeping service is poor as well. They did not refill the water bottles or clean the glasses. The furniture in the room were worn out. Drawers did not open, bed was moving; TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. The reception desk staff were rude. When I complained that the room quality was not good and it was smelly, they gave me a rude look. I told them to upgrade me to a better room and that I am more than willing to pay extra charges for that, but they said that there were no rooms available. But when I checked booking.com, I found that there were still several rooms left. The hotel staff was very rude and acted like I am some of prison inmate. The hotel management should seriously consider getting new trained and professional staff. The Guest Relation Officer (a tall lady boy kind of guy based on his appearance) was very very rude. He was very rude to me over the phone and in person. I will never stay in this hotel again.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is well decorated. It is a big complex with a variety of restaurants, street food carts and departmental stores near by. The hotel is very close to BTS Nana; within 5 to 6 minutes of walking distance.</Positivereview>

I saw pictures of new wing on the booking.com. On the reception, they were very rude. And they didn't listen our any thing. And forced to pay, while they gave us very bad room with very smell.

		<Title>Don't stay here</Title>
		<Negativereview>I just travelled for 15 hours and finally made it to the front door. Not one staff member there to greet or take my bags. I shuffled them to reception. Checked in. Still no one to help with luggage to room. Got to room myself in the so called luxury tower side of the hotel. I asked for a room high up in the tower not on the 5th floor. The room itself when I got inside the odour of mildew nearly made me fall over. The room is very big. The bathroom was dirty. I was so disappointed I will never stay there again. That is just a snippet of my experience. I would rate it 2 star at best.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Love the location.</Title>
		<Negativereview>When we arrived, we waited over 20 minutes to check in and were in a queue. however, reception staff continued to serve customers out of the queue and did not ask any of them to wait. When it was eventually our turn, we pointed out to the member of staff that we had been waiting and ignored whilst they served customers out of a queue. He basically ignored us and gave us a twin room. We had requested a double room. By now, we had lost our patience and went down to reception and asked for a double room as Per booking. The guy who was helping us began to serve another customer who refused to wait. We both asked him to wait his turn and the receptionist its apologised and sorted our room. It was ice and comfortable and was only marred by the mildew in the bathroom. Today we checked in again and had a pleasant experience. We had a great room but the wifi signal was rubbish. They could not resolve the issue, but changed our room. Tonight, after a whole day out we both wanted a shower before going to bed. But there was no hot water. We reported this and someone came to inspect the water. He advised us to leave it running for 10 minutes and left. 30 minutes later after calling housekeeping again to inform them that the water is not hot, the guy at the end of the phone mumbled something and dropped the call. We spent ages calling reception to report the problem but got no reply. My husband went down to reception and spoke with a receptionist who began to ignore him by answering another call. He later informed him there is a problem with the main boiler and the entire hotel has no hot water and with it being midnight won't be fixed tonight. It is now 1 am and I had a very incompetent desk manager call to tell me their engineer said we have hot water and when I informed him there in no hot water he asked me what he should do. I only got an apology when I said I want a refund!!!! Overall very poor customer service and amenities.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The check in lady at the reception was not nice, lied about not charging me for giving me the room from 6 am to 12 noon and then charged me Bhat 500. She would shout and scream in an un-understandable English. The room was noisy because of the bus stop it looked at. They use big bottles that they keep filling up for bath gel and shampoo instead of small disposable bottles. My first room had a leak from the toilet shower hose.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great location but lots of mold!</Title>
		<Negativereview>The first room I was given was in the main building. It was run down, dirty, and had a strong mold smell. There was visible mold growing in and around the air ducts. In the halls on the first floor and on the floor where my room was I could smell and see black mold and mildew growing around air ducts. The room was overlooking the entrance to the hotel. There were lots of buses coming late into the night and early in the morning that ran right in front of the hotel making it hard to sleep. I ended up with asthma. When I went to check out the next morning because of my asthma the manager changed my room to the tower. The building was cleaner, better kept, and had better air quality. It was quiet - but then I was upgraded and on the 22nd floor. I am shocked that a hotel with such a serious mold problem is still open and running at full capacity. It has to be dangerous to anyone with upper respiratory problems. I will not be willing to stay there again.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The location is brilliant! There are good places to eat, a wonderful spa, and good shopping right on the same block with the hotel. The hotel is a one block walk from Nana metro station. I only wish the hotel was somewhere I could stay again.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Dont use others credit card for internet booking</Title>
		<Negativereview>Internet booking is not good.I paid the rent 3 weeks before by Booking.com but they didnt cut the money, so when i arrived in the hotel i was in a great trouble as one of my agent used his credit card for me. i paid my agent before hand. The management was in hesitency to cut the money from others credit card but booking.com said that one can pay for other. Booking.com said after confirming booking the hotel cut the money in next 1-2 days,So if i know beforhand that the my money hasbeen credited, then i can take less money with me.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The rate was reasonable, Location was Nice. i was in Tower wing in 24th floor. I got many asian tourists there.Staff are very much busy but not much attentive to clients. Poor English suffers a lot. This is the BEST hotel in BKK for Bangladeshi tourists considering all circumstances.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Horrible</Title>
		<Negativereview>our 10 Wedding Anniversary and My Bday was ruined, room was dirty, old, its not a 4 star hotel it's a 'no star' hotel. we booked a superior room, and mentioned our anniversary and Bday, they gave us a room facing some bird oasis, the birds woke us up every morning at 4am, our room was right next to housekeeping and all phone calls for housekeeping we were able to hear. the entrance to go up to the rooms is a 5 min walk from reception, everytime we went up to our rooms the cards wont work, we have tog o back down and activate them. we booked this hotel based on the fact they have a nanny service, they even have a pamphlet in the room stating that, well its absolute lies, I had to spend so much money making roaming calls to try and find a nanny from outside. the bathrooms were dirty and had weird spots on the wall. one of the days we left the room at 9:30am and got back at 3pm, the room wasnt done up, no clean towels!.when the booking.com staff got intouch with the hotel they denied everything and said none was true... I have photos of everything and recordings. this Hotel is disgusting please please please please do not make a mistake of booking there.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>There should be a policy forbidding people putting towels on sun beds and then going to breakfast. A large Swedish family did this and didn't use the sun beds very much so that other people couldn't get a bed in the sun.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Centrally located, but unimpressive</Title>
		<Negativereview>My room was on the 6th floor. The room was small, with questionable level of cleanliness, and old furnishings. I felt like in an average motel. The bed was very uncomfortable - it felt like sleeping on a table actually. The windows were not soundproof, which was a major drawback for me because I wanted to relax/sleep before a long travel ahead of me.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The reception staff was friendly. My room was ready prior to regular check-in time (I marked my anticipated arrival upon booking). The hotel is located within a short walk to public transportation and the main street (Sukhumvit).</Positivereview>

		<Title>Never again !</Title>
		<Negativereview>The staff was terrible. Very sarcastic and rude. One guy at the restaurant asked where I was from and I told him I then asked where he was from and he said "where do you think" I ordered some curry and white rice and onion soup and 3piece chicken wings and it came to nearly ＄60 I couldn't believe it then I had two small bags of laundry that needed to be done they took it without giving me a price then came back and charged my card nearly $260 management was poor they didn't welcome with a smile. I also was unaware that u had a complimentary breakfast w my room package song found out the second to last day out of the 8 days I was there because they did not tell me when I was checking in. Housekeeping went through my personal belongings I was not happy and I asked why and they said it was because my bag was in the way. ** also keep in mind you will be charged for every little thing they are very petty. No microwaves in the room so they charged me 60baht each time. Also the guy in the picture made fun of me and called me stupid in his native tongue cause I was surprised it was 60 but when I called the front seat they told me it was only 6 baht</Negativereview>

We will certainly book again and recommend to family and friends!</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>The staff at the hotel were so friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. As we hadn't been to Liverpool before they asked if we knew where things were, if we needed any reservations and told us all about the things to do near the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short or long stay for any age!</Negativereview>

		<Title>All for a day at the races</Title>
		<Negativereview>The room was comfortable and had a lovely view but did not justify the price paid. Which I assume was particularly high due to Grand National Weekend. One young waitress at breakfast seemed to spend her time dropping plates and cutlery and glaring at other members of staff. Perhaps she just had an off day. I also was surprised to find that a couple of men in the bar whose language was loud and offensive were not asked to leave and their behaviour was ignored by staff in the bar and the reception area, I would not have expected this in a hotel of this calibre.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The attitude of the staff was warm and welcoming. Hannah Moss the reservation agent proved to be of great assistance to me prior to arrival. Check in was seamless and the reception team were anxious that we took advantage of the club lounge facilities that was part of our booking. The doorman was everything a good doorman should be. Breakfast was fantastic with a huge choice as I have come to expect from Plaza hotels. I loved the location of the hotel on Princess dock.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>loved this hotel- the staff were super friendly and helpful, the hotel was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had the use of the club lounge where we could have free drinks and snacks. There was a great selection of both. Check in and out was very smooth and parking at the hotel very convenient.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Basic hotel with the benefit of a pool</Title>
		<Negativereview>Wardrobe space was laughable, this was the same in our friends room too and we were told this was done during the refurbishment!!!. Coat hangers were hung over a section in the wardrobe which had a shelf approximately 18 inches below, therefore it was impossible to hang any clothes up. Expensive parking, should have been free parking if used the hotel. Overcharged on breakfast, was charged for 4 people when only 2 of us, I needed to return for a refund with no explanation how this happened</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The bed was comfortable. Enjoyed the fitness facilities and location</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Everything we used was fab.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were welcoming and the room positions were thoughtful- we were travelling with my 9 month old and my parents. We had rooms next door to each other and then our room was next to a cupboard to ensure we weren't disturbing anyone else! This was a relief as you worry about that as parents with an early riser! The beds were comfy and the climate control was effective. The view from the window was of the Mersey, although past a building, and it was interesting to watch the boats going by. The swimming pool was lovely and the poolside staff were informative and helpful. The foyer was light, airy and spacious. The onsite parking was amazing and safe. It was also cheap for the centre of Liverpool!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Staff were amazing and so friendly. The stay was for a short honeymoon. As soon as we had checked in we were offered a complimentary drink and our bags were taken to our room. We were upgraded also and had complimentary free car parking. The breakfast is amazing and there is plenty of variety depending on your dietary requirements. Location is brilliant with just a short walk into the city centre. We loved our stay and would definitely choose this hotel again if we went back to Liverpool. Thank you crowne plaza staff.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great Mersey View</Title>
		<Negativereview>the restaurant at night had a very poor performance when 7 family members ordered. With a promise of "food in 15 minutes" it was all still not on the table One hour and Fifteen minutes later! ... Some of us had finished and some of us had not been served, All in All VERY disappointing. (which the Manager recognised and compensated accordingly) BUT the meal was spoilt.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice. Bar in the evenings was nice to enjoy a night cap before bed. We had room 118 and 120- great overlooking the River. Even little touches like sleep spray added to the stay. Great location. Highly recommend.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>We stayed on a night when the temperature was fairly warm in the main, but in the restaurant it was freezing - I nearly had to put my coat on. Also, service in the restaurant was very poor - we ordered a bottle of wine which did not appear until half way through the meal. The waitress who took our food order then disappeared to take food upstairs, and by the time she came back our starters were cold.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great staff,good food, but unsuitable room</Title>
		<Negativereview>We were allocated a room for what I would imagine to be a single disabled person that was not suitable for 2 adults. My husband couldnt even get in his side of the bed as it was right up against the wall with no bedside table. If we hadnt have been tired from flying and just wanted to sleep before going out in the evening I would have asked for a different room.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Very easy check in with extremely helpful and pleasant staff member called Luke. We were too early to check in so had lunch in the bar. He tried to book us a place to eat pre-show in town but the venues were full so we ate in the restaurant. Luke was a credit to the hotel.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Fab stay, except for the bed!</Title>
		<Negativereview>As a family one bed was great but one side of the second bed the mattress needed replacing. Didn't realise at night otherwise would've complained as didn't get much sleep, felt as I was going to fall out, it was worse than camping!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Location is great. Breakfast was excellent and very organised and helpful. Pool was fab excellent size compared to some other hotels. Clean and well equipped room.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The bedrooms and bathrooms are looking a bit old-fashioned and could do with being made to look more contemporary. Hotel very very busy as it was half-term.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The best part of the stay was the friendly staff. They went out of their way to be helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel lobby and bar area are very attractive and relaxing. Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice. Hotel well situated for the Albert Docks and the Liverpool One shopping area. Bedrooms clean and comfortable although a bit old-fashioned. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Very disappointed the room was not cleaned in the time we were there, nothing nicer than to come back to a clean room and bed made it so nice to have someone do it for you thats part of the break . Also extremely disappointed that we were not told the week we booked it was school holidays and members children were allowed in the spa/pool so we did not use the facility which was one of the main reasons we booked this was to chill and have a relaxed visit to feel refreshed on our exit . Also the heating was not working in the two days of our stay on the last pm my husband reported this the maintenance came straight up to the room he apologised he said the system required resetting which he did this its ashame we it was so late in the stay as it was very cold I had sleep with extra clothing on as I have a medical condition .</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The whole place was excellent the location, the room was beautiful, clean , excellent views, the staff were so helpful , made us feel so welcome from the start to the end of our stay . The pool area and Jacuzzi looked nice even though we did not use this .The chappie who welcome us to the hotel Frank he was lovely .</Positivereview>

		<Title>Lovely stay in Liverpool</Title>
		<Negativereview>The double beds were small although there were 2 in our room we would have preferred 1 king size. The wine in the restaurant was £9.75 175ml glass which is really expensive in comparison to everything else, there was also a 10% service charge for a member of staff to carry a glass of wine and a pint, 20 paces to our table, after he told us to take a seat and he would bring it to us. £1.39 for 10 seconds, I wish I earnt that much!!!!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The staff were really helpful and friendly. The rooms were nice, the bar area was comfortable. Didn't use the spa or gym as we didn't have time but it looked very good. Will definitely return and boom more time to use the facilities.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview><![CDATA[This applies to most hotels of late but the added costs for breakfasts/parking are irksome. i would rather pay more as a basic price and have these things included. If, like us you are not a big breakfast eater but enjoy the ritual of going for tea and toast you are not going to pay £30 / £60 over 2 days for this. We went to a cafe for tea & light snacks instead.]]></Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>I am being really picky as can't really think of anything but the menu for the restaurant situated on site wasn't fantastic for what we would like to eat. We didn't dine in the restaurant so in all fairness it could be fab! We were just not excited about what was on the menu.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Staff were friendly and helpful, the room was lovely, clean and had everything you needed plus the bed was huge and very comfy!

		<Negativereview>No conditioner anywhere just shampoo (it is better to have conditioner than bubble bath). The changing rooms for pool had no toiletries at all. Only one hot chocolate for a room that sleeps four and the car park was £11 for staying guests! Cheaper to use local parking and walk which is disappointing. Very noisy room next to the staff lift which banged on and off through the night.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Breakfast was lovely and the staff serving was lovely. Rooms were a nice size and were clean. Great location, walking distance for the City Centre. Staff tried to put our two rooms close together (only five doors away). Nice aromatherapy spray to help aid a restful sleep.</Positivereview>

		<Title>Fantastic stay, great service, lovely modern room and great location</Title>
		<Negativereview>We didn't like the fact that when we were in the spa/pool area we could be seen through the window by passers by. A small complaint which would not stop us from returning. It would also have been nice to have a fridge in our room but perhaps these are reserved for the suites or larger rooms. On the upside, we did have access to a very good ice machine.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The room and soft furnishings were immaculate and very modern. Everything looked brand new. The bedding was pristine and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and we were given plenty of towels and a complimentary bath robe. The aircon/heating system worked perfectly to suit our requirements. The Crowne Plaza reception staff could not do enough to help us. Michael was extremely helpful and friendly. He gave us great recommendations for restaurants, nightclubs and local attractions and he even gave us a map and detailed directions and called us a taxi when required. As we prepared to go out for our meals, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant, however we did order a late night meal via room service and enjoyed a piping hot and very tasty curry which came to our room within 15 minutes. We even had a pillow menu and when we requested thinner pillows they were delivered to our room within minutes despite it being late at night and housekeeping being closed. We loved the fact that there was an ice machine in the corridor near the lift. On Saturday afternoon, we spent a leisurely few hours in the spa, steam room, sauna gym and pool which were very clean and spacious. The hotel is in a great location which made it easy to walk to local attractions such as Liverpool 1 Shopping Centre, The Albert Dock, Maritime Museum and Lime St Train Station. We will definitely stay at The Crowne Plaza again if/when we return to Liverpool.</Positivereview>

		<Title>take some days from your london stay and come to liverpool and this hotel!</Title>
		<Negativereview>All great!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Bed was divine. I had a waterfront room and loved the working harbour view. Super quiet room. Nice relaxation sleep kit. Reaturant was bsic to look at but great food. And throughout the hotel, fabulous service. Everyone was genuinely friendly. A bit far from centre of twon in the cold winds but right at the harbour and manya attractions there. Could have spent 4 days touring around thsi architecturally beautiful, vibrant and safe city. Sadly unknown as a great place to come and not just for the beatles!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The room was tiny ( room number 400 ). The bath room door was broken and wouldn't even close. The showers temperature was either scolding hot or freezing cold. We ran reception at 7pm to ring for a taxi for us for 7:35 but they had failed to do this and for this reason we missed our reservation. The standard of the hotel was no more different than a Premier Inn but your paying twice the price.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Plug in bath jammed so shower resulted in a filled bath - not ideal when more than one person to be showered. Breakfast order placed on door precious night so we could have breakfast in room - was still on door the next morning and no breakfast delivered so had to call reception and highlight it to them. Lucky we weren't in a real rush and noticed early. Member of staff in restaurant was far from pleasant - made it feel like a hassle that we wanted to dine here. Then the dinner wasn't great, was edible but wouldn't be in a rush to dine there again.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Excellent location and most staff very friendly - mainly reception staff! Was able to check in early (about 9.30) which was great to drop off bags and freshen up before heading in to the centre. Good facilities on offer e.g. pillow menu, sleeping aids, robes in room, leisure facilities etc! Great nights sleep - not much noise (just some due to bad weather outside but not hotels fault) and very comfy bed. Would stay again based on location and if good offer but would avoid dining.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Almost £5 a pint of lager, no crisps or nuts etc available at the bar. Wallpaper pealing off bedroom wall. Bed so soft it was like sleeping in a marshmallow and my husband fell out twice! Breakfast was cold and fried potatoes so hard they shot off the plate and inedible. Waitress at breakfast told me I'd have to pay for my breakfast and wouldn't listen when I told her we had paid with the booking. 2" gap under bedroom door (room 214) that you could easily SEE into the room. Window was bolted shut so no air. Very very disappointed and wouldn't stay again.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great location, OK hotel!</Title>
		<Negativereview>These beautiful old buildings do not provide good sound insulation. We were in 402 and the people in room 401 (and there was an empty room between us) talked and laughed into the night. The hotel staff did their best to quiet them and, at 4a.m., moved us to a quieter room. They deducted the cost of that night from our bill. The breakfasts were very basic. Sausages OK but the scrambled eggs were anaemic and tasteless. Only one of two lifts was working!</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Historic building in great location and close to so many places of interest. Rooms come with view of the docks or the Mersey. Delightful and very helpful staff.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The breakfast was not quite what we had envisaged. Although there was always something to eat the hot food was not as hot as it might have been. The fruit also left a bit to be desired. We only had a drink in the bar on one evening as no ice was available.</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>The bed was really comfortable and the pillows were excellent, not too soft and not too hard. There was a nice view from our window. It was also located at a great spot, near The Beatles Story and conveniently beside restaurants, bars and a stone's throw from the Museum and Liverpool One.</Positivereview>

		<Positivereview>Brilliant location opposite the arena. Staff were very friendly and helpful, as we were trying to find our room a lovely member of staff offered to show us to our room and made sure we got in okay, and gave us some tips to further improve our stay. The room was very nice, good facilities and very spacious. We asked for a view of the arena as we were attending a concert that night and got exactly what we wanted. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and will definitely be staying here again in the future!</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The hotel is in a fabulous location with plenty of bars and restaurants on your doorstep. I have never been to a hotel so quiet at night (we were on the 4th floor) Breakfast was very good buffet style but must admit i did miss a fried egg and some bacon, but plenty of choice otherwise. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, I would certainly recommend staying here, i wouldn't stay anywhere else in Liverpool.... Thank you for a great stay.</Negativereview>

Hot food was limited to sausages, scrambled egg and beans which wasn't great but it was free with the room. Add bacon and hash browns and the breakfast would have been perfect!</Negativereview>

		<Positivereview>Room 238 (including bed) very comfortable with view across the Mersey. Close to reception area so convenient for coming and going. Able to leave luggage in safe area on departure morning and collect later at no extra cost.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The so called room with a view of the river was totally obscured with a bright orange/pink metal brace which supported the building so not really a view. One problem was a fire drill which went wrong and meant that we had to walk down several flights of steps leaving our Breakfast.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>The hotel is situated in an old building which has been renovated to modern standards. Our room was fine and the walk in shower a bonus for my wife who suffers from arthritis.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Breakfast was a little on the average side, with cooked elements tasting sub standard? ie: Scrambled Eggs seemed to be from the pre mixed type, very tasteless. Decor although clean is becoming dated and worn in some areas, such as wooden furniture and room carpets. Which is a shame as the building, location and staff are amazing and it could easily be of a higher standard if re-vamped.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great Location, Very Clean, Beautiful Rooms and Views, Friendly staff, Poor Breakfast</Title>
		<Negativereview>The Breakfast was the only let down for this lovely hotel, we went done early the first morning and later the second morning. On both occasions they only had scrambled eggs (not the nicest), beans and sausages for hot options, the pastries were very cold and tasted like they had been made hours before, one of the coffee machines didn't work and the other only had certain coffees (as a coffee lover the coffee was not very good). On the up side of the breakfast there was a good selection of cereals, yogurts and nice rolls.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>It was probably the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in (the housekeeping staff are clearly very good at there jobs). The room is really lovely, good size, beautiful view and I think every room has a view. I loved how the kept the original red brick throughout the hotel as well. The location is perfect, only 5 minutes walk to Liverpool One, plenty of nice restaurants and bars close by and perfect for a stroll around!</Positivereview>

The receptionist then laid the blame at the door of Booking.com and advised me that in the "small print" it would've explained that a double room would not have been guaranteed.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Our double bed needed a mattress topper - so we compromised by asking for another duvet (to lie on). Good result !</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Fantastic location at Albert Dock; a hotel-with-a-difference - designed within a former warehouse, mixing history with modern. We were impressed. Accommodation cost included breakfast which had a decent choice of self-service food. Plenty of visitor information at the entrance foyer. Some rooms look out onto Albert Dock. Staff were helpful and friendly. There's parking right outside the hotel, at £15 for 24hrs (as at January 2016). Discounted parking, we understand, at the Echo Arena car park further away.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>Cheap best describes this property. Ordered a double and got two singles that were very uncomfortable - cheap and springy - no support. Room lacked air conditioning - hot and stuffy. The breakfast is a badly designed cheap buffet and the seating is reminiscent of motorway services. There was no room safe and the parking is not £9.00 as advertised but £15.00 (DEC/2015). If willing to park half a mile away it is £12.00 per day with the hotel discount.</Negativereview>

The staff tried to help as best they could but I ended up having to park on the road and having to make sure it was moved by 9am. This let it down slightly, but the staff made sure we weren't charged for the parking.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Its trivia really, Shame we had to wait for our eggs to cook at breakfast while everything else was buffet and available. Will know next time to order eggs and wait to collect breakfast! Plus only 2 sockets in the room, rather interesting with two adults and a 14 year old</Negativereview>

		<Title>Great value for money</Title>
		<Negativereview>The rooms are so dark that getting ready unless you do this all in the bathroom is quite tricky. The room was next to a lift so there was quite a lot of noise all night, then in the morning the bottles were being poured into the bottle bank outside our room which woke me up so didn't really have a good night sleep.</Negativereview>

		<Negativereview>Mix up with checking out, we had a late check out arranged, then got a phone call whilst shopping in the city asking us to check out? Disappointed that the price of breakfast varies when there is a football match on, I think breakfast should be a set price, but I do understand the room rate will go up when there is a match on.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Next to Norwich City Football Ground. Breakfast very good value.</Positivereview>

Don't know if I was just unlucky but both reception and waiting staff were "in training" and took absolutely ages to perform simple tasks. No sign of a supervisor/ trained staff.</Negativereview>

		<Title>Mr Johnson is very upset!!</Title>
		<Negativereview>Oh where do i start!!! Parking you only have 5 free parking spaces at the front of the hotel which we didn't know about till we was just about to leave?? We just followed the signs saying hotel carpark then got charged 5:95 when we left 😱 this is the first time in my life i had to pay to leave my car at a hotel.. Then we get to our room which was ok till we put the hot water on and it was to hot should have signs up saying water very hot before someone gets burnt 😔 then just before we went out for our evening i ironed my top and the iron was Naffed as it marked my top and it was leaking of water another hazard!!! Then we got up to go for breakfast arrived in the breakfast area just before 10:30 was greated by a gentleman to take our seats in the conversation we had between us he told us we haven't got long to they take the food away at 11 am so we felt under pressure to rush our breakfast.. Anyway i ordered some porridge it took for ever to come to our table.. So my partner said i think it's best you grab yourself something hot before it gets taken away.. So i did which i was still waiting for my porridge 😔 really upset with the whole experience as you guys were recommended by a good friend.. Also it was new year eve and my partners birthday and my new top got damaged not happy at all</Negativereview>

		<Title>Clean but very basic</Title>
		<Negativereview>Place was dated, hadn't seen a refurbishment since the mid-1960s. Everything creaked, even breathing loudly made the floors and walls creak. Bed springs were worn out and the mattress was almost threadbare. My room and bathroom were very clean but the bathtub had not seen a descaler in about 20 years. There was virtually no hot water in the shower even after running the tap on for 10 minutes. I paid around 55 quid per night for my stay which was at least 25 quid too much for what I got in return. The only young girl in reception I had to deal with was thick as a brick - she should learn from her elderly colleagues. There was no picture on the screen monitor of what passed for a TV, only a message that said No Signal. None of the channels worked.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>location is handy, 5 minute walk to the station and the bus stop on your door step. Staff were lovely, polite, pleasant, and helpful. Having elderly staff in the reception made a difference as they were good at details and looking after things. Room was scrupulously clean but basic. Online food deliveries are possible so that was handy. Cleaning services were good.</Positivereview>

		<Title>I can not recommend this place</Title>
		<Negativereview>Room 51 = windows wide open when we went into the room, on a freezing night. No heating. Radiator turned off. When turned on it got luke warm after about 3 hours. Dehumidifier box hidden behind curtain Dirty broken umbrella left on seat in the room. Light on one side of bed not working Duvet = approx 1 tog. Covered in ancient duvet cover, probably clean but brown grunge does not indicate well. No spare blanket in cupboard. Bathroom = hot water in basin taps took nearly half an hour to come in. Strong smell of drains. Shower head disgusting - caked with ancient brown lime. TMV did not work adequately. Either too hot or very cold. No working heating in the bathroom Decor throughout hotel tired and appeared dirty. Badly Scuffed and marked paintwork, peeling wallpaper. Disgusting looking carpet on stairs to second floor Arrived on a Friday night (admittedly late) but request for food was met with 'you can order a take-away'. Other guests very noisy throughout the night and ALL nocturnal goings on could be heard through walls and from across corridor. Other guests not the hotel's fault but thin walls are. I had approximately 3 hours sleep and was working all day after this.</Negativereview>
		<Positivereview>Breakfast was OK - Gluten Free Bread was provided. Excellent poached eggs. Margarine replaced with butter when requested. Pillow cases and bottom sheet were clean.</Positivereview>

		<Negativereview>The boiler apparently could not be turned off so the whole building was hot from top to bottom. I had to keep the window open during the night to get some comfort, as my radiator would not turn off. I was given a fan which didn't work and at that point I couldn't be bothered. Ironically in the morning the water from the shower was luke warm, given that the building was a furnace. I also swapped room earlier because the mattress was so worn it was leaning to the side.</Negativereview>
